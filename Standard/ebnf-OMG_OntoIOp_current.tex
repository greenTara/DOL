\sectionWN{OMG}

Founded in 1989, the Object Management Group, Inc. (OMG) is an open membership, not-for-profit computer industry standards consortium that produces and maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable, portable, and
 reusable enterprise applications in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Membership includes Information Technology vendors, end users, government agencies, and academia. 

OMG member companies write, adopt, and maintain its specifications following a mature, open process. OMG's specifications implement the Model Driven Architecture\textregistered\xspace (MDA\textregistered\xspace), maximizing ROI through a full-lifecycle approach to enterprise integration that covers multiple operating systems, programming languages, middleware and networking infrastructures, and software development environments. OMG's specifications include: UML\textregistered\xspace (Unified Modeling Language\texttrademark\xspace); CORBA\textregistered\xspace (Common Object Request Broker Architecture); CWM\texttrademark\xspace (Common Warehouse Metamodel); and industry-specific standards for dozens of vertical markets.

More information on the OMG is available at http://www.omg.org/.


\sectionWN{OMG Specifications}	

As noted, OMG specifications address middleware, modeling and vertical domain frameworks. All OMG Specifications are available from the OMG website at:

\url{http://www.omg.org/spec}

6.5.1(a) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for relationships between the components
of logically heterogeneous OMS, particularly, given a language translation from a language L1 to
another language L2, the application of the language translation to an OMS that is written in the
language L1. &
\DOL provides the required translation construct using syntax \syntax{O with translation t}, see \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS}.
Moreover, \DOL provides heterogeneous interpretations between OMS, see \ref{c:oms-mappings} and \ref{a:dol-text:mappings}. 
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.1(b) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for the union of OMS written in
different languages, which implicitly involves the application of suitable default translations in
order to reach a common target language. &
The syntax for unions is \syntax{O1 and O2}, see \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS}. Default translations are discussed in
\ref{c:OMS}, and \DOL's notion of heterogeneous logical
environment explicitly specifies default translations, see \ref{c:direct-sematics}.
	\\ \hline
%
6.5.1(c) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for importation in modular OMS.	&
\DOL allows the import of OMS by their IRI, see \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS}.
	\\  \hline
%
6.5.1(d) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for relationships between OMS and their
extracted modules e.g. the whole theory is a conservative extension of the module. 	&
\DOL provides such a construct with syntax \syntax{module m : o1 of o2 for sig}, see \ref{c:oms-mappings} and \ref{a:dol-text:mappings}.
	\\ \hline
%
6.5.1(e) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for relationships between OMS and their
approximation in less expressive languages such that the approximation is logically implied by the
original theory, where the approximation generally has to be maximal in some suitable sense. 	&
\DOL provides such a construct with syntax \syntax{o keep logic},  see \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS}.	\\ \hline
%
6.5.1(f) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for links such as imports,
interpretations, refinements, and alignments between OMS/modules.
	&
\DOL covers several metalogical relationships, namely entailments, interpretations, equivalences, refinements, alignments and module relations, see \ref{c:oms-mappings} and \ref{a:dol-text:mappings}.
	\\ \hline
%
6.5.1(g) & 
Proposals shall provide a specification of a metalanguage for combination of OMS along links. 	&
\DOL provides such a construct with syntax \syntax{combine n}, where \syntax{n} is a network of OMS and mappings (links),  see \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS}.
	\\ \hline
%
6.5.2(a)& 
The constructs of the metalanguage shall be applicable to different logics.	&
The semantics of \DOL is based on a heterogeneous logical
environment, which can contain arbitrary logics, see \ref{c:direct-sematics}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.2(b)& 
The metalanguage shall neither be restricted to OMS in a specific domain, nor to OMS represented
in a specific logical language.	&
The semantics of \DOL is based on a heterogeneous logical
environment, which can contain arbitrary logics, see \ref{c:direct-sematics}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.2(c)& 
The metalanguage shall not replace the object language constructs of the conforming logical
languages.	&
The syntax of a \syntax{NativeDocument} is left unspecified in this standard. Rather, here this standard relies on other
standards and language definitions.
See \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.2(d)& 
The metalanguage shall provide syntactic constructs for (i) structuring OMS regardless of the
logic in which their sentences are formalized and (ii) basic and structured OMS and facilities to
identify them in a globally unique way.
	&
The structuring constructs for OMS in \ref{c:OMS} and \ref{a:dol-text:OMS} can be used for 
any logic, see the semantics in \ref{c:direct-sematics}. \DOL uses IRIs for referencing both basic and structured OMS, see
\ref{c:iris}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.3(a)& 
An abstract syntax specified as an SMOF compliant meta model.	&
\cbs The abstract syntax is specified using SMOF, see clause \ref{c:abstract-syntax}. An EBNF variant is given in annex \ref{a:EBNF}. \cbe
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.3(b)& 
A human-readable lexical concrete syntax in EBNF and serialization in XML, for the latter XMI shall
be used.	&
The concrete syntax (in EBNF) is specified in clause \ref{c:abstract-syntax}. The XMI representation 
is automatically derived from the SMOF meta model.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.3(c)& 
Complete round-trip mappings from the human-readable concrete syntax to the abstract syntax and
vice versa.	&
\cbs The metaclasses of the MOF abstract syntax are used as non-terminals
of the EBNF concrete syntax (clause 
\ref{c:abstract-syntax});\cbe this makes a round-trip mapping between both straight-forward. Moreover, the 
round-trip mapping has been implemented in form of a parser and a printer as part of the 
heterogeneous tool set \cbs (see appendix~\ref{a:tools} and \cbe \url{http:hets.eu}).
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.3(d)& 
A formal semantics for the abstract syntax.	&
The formal semantics is given in clause \ref{c:semantics}.
   \\ \hline
%
%
6.5.4(a)& 
Existing OMS in existing serializations shall validate as OMS in the metalanguage with a minimum
amount of syntactic adaptation.	& 
Any document providing an OMS in a serialization of a \DOL conforming
language can be used as-is in \DOL, by reference to its IRI.
See \ref{sec:existing-serialization}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.4(b)& 
It shall be possible to refer to existing files/documents from an OMS implemented in the
metalanguage without the need for modifying these files/documents.	&
Documents can be referenced by IRIs, see \ref{c:iris}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.4(c)& 
Translations between logical languages shall preserve (possibly to different degrees) the semantics
of the logical languages. Between a given pair of logical languages, several translations are
possible.	&
The semantics of \DOL is based on a heterogeneous logical
environment, which contains institution comorphisms as translations, see \ref{c:direct-sematics}. 
Institution comorphisms preserve semantics
in a weak form through their satisfaction condition. The \DOL Ontology specifies properties of 
translations (comorphisms) preserving more and more of the semantics, see annex 
\ref{a:dol-onto}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.5(a)& 
Informative annexes shall establish the conformance of a number of relevant logical languages. An
initial set of language translations may be part of an informative annex.	&
For conformance of logical languages, see 6.5.5(b) below.
Conformance of some translations is established in annex \ref{a:graph}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.5(b)& 
Conformance of the following subset of logical languages  shall be established: OWL2 (with profiles
EL, RL, QL), CLIF, RDF, UML class diagrams.
	&
 Conformance of the following languages is established: OWL 2 (annex \ref{a:owl}), CLIF (annex \ref{a:cl}), RDF and RDF Schema (annex \ref{a:rdfs}), UML class diagrams (annex \ref{a:uml-class}).
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.5(c)& 
Conformance of a suitable set of translations among the languages mentioned in the previous bullet
point shall be established.	&
Conformance of some translations is established in annex \ref{a:graph}.
   \\ \hline
%
6.5.6 & 
Existing standards and best practices for allocating globally unique identifiers shall be reused.
The same standards and best practices shall also be applied to associate different representations
of the same content to one unique identifier.	&
\DOL uses IRIs to reference documents (both \DOL documents, as well
as documents written in some conforming language). See \ref{c:iris}.

Do existing language standards need to be extended or adapted in order to make them OntoIOp

The goal of \DOL is to support existing languages without any
adaptations, see also 6.5.4(a). However, in order to meet
requirement 6.5.6, \DOL-conforming languages should support the
use of IRIs. If they do not, there is a mechanism for assigning IRIs
to (fragments of) language documents even if the language itself does not support
this, see \ref{c:conform:serialization}.
Moreover, there is a mechanism for injecting IRIs in existing language serializations, see \ref{sec:existing-serialization} and \ref{c:req:annotation}.

\clause{Scope}
\pagenumbering{arabic} 
This \IS specifies the Distributed Ontology, Model and Specification
 Language (\DOL)\index{\dolindex ! definition}.  \DOL is designed to achieve integration  
and interoperability of
ontologies, specifications and models (OMS for short). \DOL is a language for
distributed knowledge representation, system specification and 
model-driven development across multiple OMS, particularly OMS
 that have been formalized in different OMS languages.\ednote{Suggestion from Terry: ``\DOL is a tool for managing and manipulating distributed knowledge representations, system specifications, and model-driven design/development artifacts among multiple OMS, particularly...''. However, I think \DOL is not a tool, but a language. Hence, this does not fit. TM} 
This \IS responds to the
OntoIOp Request for Proposals \cite{RFP}.


\section{Background Information}
Logical languages are used in several fields of computing for the development of formal, 
machine-processable texts that carry a formal semantics. Among those fields are 1) 
\textbf{O}ntologies 
 formalizing domain knowledge, 2) (formal) \textbf{M}odels of systems, and 3) the formal 
\textbf{S}pecification
of systems. Ontologies, models  and specifications will (for the purpose of this document) 
henceforth be abbreviated as \textbf{OMS}\index{OMS}.

An OMS provides formal descriptions, which range in scope from domain knowledge and activities
(ontologies, models) to properties and behaviors of hardware and software systems (models,
specifications). These formal descriptions can be used for the analysis and verification of domain
models, system models and systems themselves, using rigorous and effective reasoning tools.   As 
systems increase in complexity, it becomes concomitantly less practical to provide a monolithic 
logical cover for all.  Instead various models are developed to represent different viewpoints or 
perspectives on a domain or system. 
 Hence, interoperability becomes
a crucial issue, in particular, formal interoperability, i.e.\ interoperability that is based on
the formal semantics of the different viewpoints. Interoperability is both about the ability to 
interface different domains and systems and the ability to use several OMS in a common application
scenario. Further,  interoperability is about coherence and consistency, ensuring at an early stage of the development
that a coherent system can be reached.


In complex applications, which involve multiple OMS with overlapping concept spaces,
it is often necessary to identify correspondences between concepts in the different OMS; this is called  OMS alignment\index{alignment}. 
While OMS alignment is most commonly studied for OMS formalized in the same OMS 
language, the different OMS used by complex applications may also be written in different 
OMS languages, which may even vary in their expressiveness. 
This \IS faces this diversity not by proposing yet another OMS language that would subsume all the others.  
Instead, it accepts the diverse reality and formulates means (on a sound and formal semantic basis) 
to compare and integrate OMS that are written in different formalisms.
It specifies \DOL, a formal language for
expressing not only OMS but also mappings between OMS formalized in different OMS languages.

Thus, \DOL gives interoperability a formal grounding and makes heterogeneous OMS and services based
on them amenable to checking of coherence (\eg consistency, conservativity, intended consequences,
and compliance).

%\ednote{this could be put in section 1 (if possible with OMG), or turned into informative
%  notes, or deleted}
%An ontology is a formal description of the concepts and relationships
%that are of interest to an agent or a community of agents. Today,
%ontologies are applied in eBusiness, eHealth, eGovernment, eInclusion,
%eLearning, smart environments, ambient assisted living (AAL), and
%virtually all other information-rich endeavours. Ontologies have been
%used initially and principally for data and database integration
%through providing a common representation of the subject domain onto
%which the data sources can be mapped meaningfully. Over the years, the
%purpose has broadened beyond data and services interoperability to
%include a wide range of tasks and ontologies are used in information
%systems at run-time, such as being a component in \emph{in silico}
%scientific workflows, used for natural language processing, in
%ontology-driven querying of digital libraries, user profiling in
%recommender systems, adaptive e-Learning tools, and
%more.\todonote[author=Terry
%Longstreth,date=D:201110060000+02'00']{Terry Longstreth:
%  Interoperability in this context seems to be mutual consistency?
%  Fostering Mutual Consistency among disjoint ontological formalisms
%  (intensions) and their realisations (extensions). TM: yes, but more
%  than that: also interfacability, such that the joint use in a common
%  application scenario is enabled.}



\section{Features Within Scope}\index{\dolindex ! scope}
% Can't use \begin{inscope}, as that creates an itemize environment
The following are within the scope of this \IS:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{it:scope-heterogeneous} homogeneous OMS as well as heterogeneous OMS (OMS that consist of\cbs parts written\cbe in different languages);
\item mappings between OMS (mapping OMS symbols to OMS symbols);
\item OMS networks (\cbs{}involving\cbe several OMS and mappings between them);
\item \label{it:scope-translation} translations between different OMS languages conforming with \DOL (translating\cbs a\cbe whole OMS to another language);
\item\label{it:scope-annotation} annotation and documentation of OMS, mappings between OMS, symbols,
and sentences;
\item recommendations of vocabularies for annotating and documenting OMS;
\item a syntax for embedding the constructs mentioned under (\ref{it:scope-heterogeneous})–(\ref{it:scope-annotation}) as annotations into existing OMS;
\item a syntax for expressing (\ref{it:scope-heterogeneous})–(\ref{it:scope-translation}) as standoff markup that points into existing OMS;
\item a formal semantics of (\ref{it:scope-heterogeneous})–(\ref{it:scope-translation});
\item structuring constructs for modeling non-monotonic behavior; 
\item criteria for existing or future OMS languages to conform with \DOL.
\end{enumerate}

The following are outside the scope of this \IS:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the (re)definition of elementary OMS languages, \ie languages that allow the declaration of OMS symbols (non-logical symbols) 
and
stating sentences about them;
\item algorithms for obtaining mappings between OMS;
\item concrete OMS and their conceptualization and application;
%% I believe that this is really obsolete now. –Christoph Lange, 2011-12-13
% \item a formal definition of interoperability and how to measure the degree of interoperability of two systems\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110182133+02'00']{Well, now this might even be in scope.  We'll see...}
\item mappings between services and devices, and definitions of service and device interoperability;
\item non-monotonic logics\footnote{Only monotonic logics are within scope of this specification. Conformance criteria for non-monotonic logics are still under development. However, closure (i.e.\ employing a closed-world assumption) provides non-monotonic reasoning in \DOL. It is also possible to include non-monotonic logics by construing entailments between formulas as sentences of the institution.}. 

\end{enumerate}

This \IS describes the syntax and the semantics of the Distributed Ontology, Model and
Specification Language (\DOL) by defining an abstract syntax and an associated model-theoretic
semantics for \DOL. 


\clause{Conformance}\label{c:conformance}
\index{conformance|(}
This clause defines conformance criteria for languages and logics that can be used with \DOL, as well as conformance criteria for
serializations, translations and applications. The conformance of a
number of OMS languages (namely OWL 2, Common Logic, RDF and RDF Schema, UML Class Diagrams, CASL) as well as translations among
these is discussed in informative annexes of this \IS.



\sclause{Conformance of an OMS Language/a Logic with \DOL}\label{c:conform:logic}

\begin{fminipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Rationale}: for an OMS language to conform with \DOL,
\begin{itemize}
\item its logical language aspect\index{language aspect ! logical} either needs to satisfy certain criteria \cbs related to its own abstract syntax and formal semantics\cbe, or there must be a translation (again satisfying certain
criteria) to a language that already is \DOL-conforming.
\item its structuring language aspect\index{language aspect ! structuring} (if present) must \cbs be compatible\cbe\ with \DOL's own structuring
mechanisms
\item its annotation language aspect\index{language aspect ! annotation} must \cbs be compatible\cbe\ with \DOL's meta-language constructs.
\end{itemize}
\cbs Several conformance levels are defined. They differ with respect \cbe{}to the usage of IRIs as identifiers for all kinds 
of entities that the OMS language supports.
\end{fminipage}


%
%\begin{description}
%\item[Entailment conformance] An OMS language is entailment conformant with \DOL if
%its logic is presented as a (not necessarily monotonic) entailment system.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=todo]{if we want belief revision, we need to talk about "lists of sentences" (i.e. something ordered)}\footnote{Text that goes into ``terms and definitions'': an entailment system consists of a set of sentences $\Sen(\Sigma)$ and a relation $\operatorname{\vdash}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Sen(\Sigma))\times \Sen(\Sigma)$, indexed by signatures $\Sigma$ and compatible with signature morphisms.}
%
%\item[Semantic conformance] 
%\end{description}

An OMS language is conforming with \DOL if it satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item its abstract syntax is specified as an SMOF compliant meta model
or as an EBNF grammar;
\item it has at least one serialization in the sense of section~\ref{c:conform:serialization};
%\item complete round-trip mappings from the human-readable serialization
%to the abstract syntax and vice versa;
\item either there exists a translation of it into a conforming
  language\footnote{For  example, consider the translation of OBO1.4
    to OWL, giving a formal semantics to OBO1.4.}, or:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the logical language aspect\index{language aspect ! logical} (for expressing basic OMS) is conforming, and in particular has a semantics (see below),
\item  the structuring language aspect\index{language aspect ! structuring} (for expressing structured OMS and relations
between those) is conforming (see below), and
\item the annotation language aspect\index{language aspect ! annotation} (for expressing comments and annotations)
is conforming (see below).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


The \emph{logical language aspect}\index{language aspect ! logical} of an OMS language
is %semantically
conforming with \DOL if each logic corresponding to a profile (including
the logic corresponding to the whole logical language aspect) is presented as an
institution \cbs in the sense of Definition~\ref{def:inst} in clause~\ref{c:semantics}\cbe , and there is a mapping from
the abstract syntax of the OMS language to signatures and sentences
of the institution.
% It may additionally be presented as an institution, leading
%to the possibility of interpreting additional \DOL language constructs.%
Note that one OMS language can have several sublanguages or profiles 
corresponding to several logics (for example, OWL 2 has profiles EL, RL and QL, apart from the
whole OWL 2 itself).


The \emph{structuring language aspect}\index{language aspect ! structuring} of an OMS language is conforming with \DOL if it can be
mapped to \DOL's structuring language in a semantics-preserving way. The structuring language aspect
\may be empty.

The \emph{annotation language aspect}\index{language aspect ! annotation} of an OMS language is conforming with \DOL if its constructs
have no impact on the semantics. The annotation language aspect \shall be non-empty; it \shall
provide the facility to express comments.

\cbs
Concerning item 1.\ in the definition of \DOL conformance of OMS
languages above, the following levels of conformance of the abstract
syntax of an OMS language with \DOL are defined,\cbe\ 
listed from highest to lowest:

\begin{description}
\item[Full IRI conformance] The abstract syntax specifies that IRIs be used for
 identifying all symbols and entities.
\item[No mandatory use of IRIs] The abstract syntax does not require  IRIs
 to be used to identify entities. Note that this includes the case of
  optionally supporting IRIs without enforcing their use (such as in Common
  Logic).
\end{description}

Any conforming language and logic shall have a machine-processable description
 as detailed in \cref{c:conform:description}.

\ssclause{Conformance of language/logic translations with \DOL}\label{c:conform:translation}
\begin{fminipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Rationale}: a translation between logics must satisfy certain criteria in order to conform with \DOL.
Also, a translation between OMS languages based on such logics must be consistent with the
translation between these logics.  Translations should break neither structuring language aspects nor comments/annotations\index{language aspect ! (general)}.
\end{fminipage}

A logic translation is conforming with \DOL if it is presented either as an institution morphism or
as an institution comorphism.  
%If the
%languages are presented additionally as institutions, the translations
%\may also be presented as an institution morphism or an institution
%comorphism.

A language translation \shall provide a mapping between
the abstract syntaxes (it \may also provide mappings between concrete
syntaxes). 
A language translation  from language $L_1$ (based on institution
$I_1$) to language $L_2$ (based on institution $I_2$) is conforming
with \DOL if it is based on a logic translation such\cbs that\cbe the following
diagram commutes (i.e.\ following both possible paths from 
$L_1$ to $I_2$ leads to the same result):
$$\xymatrix{
L_1 \ar[rrrrr]^{\Text{mapping between abstract syntaxes}} \ar[ddd]_{\Text{abstract syntax to institution}}
&&&&& L_2 \ar[ddd]^{\Text{abstract syntax to institution}}\\
&&&&&\\
&&&&&\\
I_1\ar[rrrrr]^{\Text{institution (co)morphism}} &&&&& I_2
}$$
Language
translations \may also translate the structuring language aspect, in
this case, they \shall preserve the semantics of the structuring
language aspect.  Furthermore, language translations \should preserve
comments and annotations.  All comments attached to a sentence (or
symbol) in the source \should be attached to its translation in the
target (if there\cbs is\cbe more than one sentences (respectively symbols)
expressing the translation, to at least one of them).

\sclause{Conformance of a Serialization of an OMS Language With \DOL}\label{c:conform:serialization}
\begin{fminipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Rationale}: The main reason for the following specifications is identifier injection. \DOL is capable
of assigning identifiers to entities (symbols, axioms, modules, etc.) inside fragments of OMS
languages that occur in a \DOL document, even if that OMS language does not support such identifiers
by its own means. 
Such identifiers will be visible to a \DOL tool, but not to a tool that only supports the OMS
language.  To achieve this without breaking the formal semantics of that OMS language,
 \cbs \DOL utilizes \cbe the \termref{annotation} or commenting features that the OMS language supports, 
 in order to place such
identifiers inside annotations/ comments.  
Depending on the nature of\cbs a given concrete\cbe
serialization of the OMS language (be it plain text, some serialization of RDF, XML, or some other 
structured text format), one can be more specific about what the annotation/commenting facilities of
that serialization must look like in order to support this identifier injection.  
Well-behaved XML and RDF schemas support identifier injection in a `nice' way (rather than using
text-level comments). \cbs In the worst case it is not possible to
inject something into an OMS language fragment, because the OMS language serialization 
does not enable the addition of suitable comments. In this case the solution is to point into the OMS language fragment from the enclosing context \cbe
by using \termref{standoff markup}.


Further conformance criteria in this section are introduced to facilitate the convenient reuse of
verbatim fragments of OMS language inside a \DOL document.

Independently from these criteria,  \cbs several levels of conformance of a
serialization are distinguished. They differ with respect to their means of conveniently abbreviating long IRI identifiers. \cbe
\end{fminipage}

\cbs There are seven levels of conformance of a serialization of an OMS language with \DOL{}.
\cbe

\begin{description}
\item[XMI conformance]
An XMI serialization \cbs for OMS written in the OMS language \cbe\ has been automatically derived from the SMOF specification
of the abstract syntax, using the canonical MOF 2 XMI Mapping.
%\ednote{Christoph to all: I'm not sure how MOF and XMI works, i.e. how to inject identifiers into comments there. TM: XMI is an XML-based format.}
\item[XML conformance]
The given serialization has to be specified as an XML schema\footnote{\cbs This refers \cbe to the general \emph{concept} of a schema, not of the W3C XML Schema language as one way of implementing it.  It is not even required that a machine-readable implementation of the schema serialization exists.}, which satisfies
 all of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The elements of the schema belong to one or more non-empty XML
namespaces.%\todonote[author=Christoph
%Lange,date=D:201110051438+02'00',type=fyi]{That means that in a heterogeneous
%OMS we can recognize that a sentence is, \eg, stated in OWL, without
%explicitly ``tagging'' it as ``OWL'' (which we would have to do in the case
%of  a serialization that is merely text conforming).}
\item The serialization shall use XML \emph{elements} to represent all structural elements of an OMS.
\item The schema shall not forbid both attributes and child elements from foreign namespaces (here: the
 \DOL namespace \url{http://www.omg.org/spec/DOL/1.0/xml}) on any elements. (This  is because either an attribute or a child element is used to inject identifiers into elements of the XML serialization; cf. clause~\ref{sec:existing-serialization}.)
\end{itemize}

\item[RDF conformance]
The given serialization has to be specified as an RDF vocabulary, which
 satisfies all of the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The elements of the vocabulary belong to one or more RDF namespaces
 identified by absolute URIs.
\item\label{it:ids-for-structure} The serialization shall specify ways of giving IRIs or URIs to all structural elements of an OMS. (The  rationale is that RDF\cbs syntax supports the identification of\cbe any kinds of items, so an RDF-based serialization of an OMS language should not forbid making use of such RDF constructs that do allow for identifying arbitrary items.)
% \todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201109221422+02'00',type=q-aut]{Update on 2014-10-09: Is it OK to have this footnote here?  Or if not, where should it go?  I believe it answers the following question:\\ And what if it doesn't? \eg OWL doesn't specify IRIs for import declarations, so we can, \eg, not annotate them when using the RDF serialization of OWL. We could only do it via RDF reification, or by using an XML serialization.}
\item There shall be no additional rules (stated in writing in the specification of the serialization, or formalized in its implementation in, e.g., OWL) that forbid properties from foreign vocabulary namespaces to be stated about arbitrary subjects for the purpose of annotation.
\end{enumerate}

The serialization of OWL in RDF, for example, does not satisfy \cbs{} requirement (\ref{it:ids-for-structure}) for RDF conformance because\cbe{} there is an \texttt{owl:imports} property but no class representing imports. 
 Therefore, it is not possible to represent a concrete import, of an ontology $O_1$ importing an ontology $O_2$, as a resource that could have an identifier.  RDF reification would allow for giving the statement $O_1$ \texttt{owl:imports} $O_2$ an identifier. 
 However, the RDF triples resulting from this reification, including, e.g., the triple \texttt{:import\_id rdf:predicate owl:imports},  would not match the head of any rule in the mapping from RDF graphs to the OWL structural specification\footnote{\nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-mapping-to-rdf:2012}, section 3}. 
 They would thus remain left over in the RDF graph that is attempted to be parsed into an OWL ontology, and thus violate the requirement that at the end of this parsing process, the RDF graph must be empty\footnote{See the last sentence of section 3.2.5 of \nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-mapping-to-rdf:2012}}.



\item[Text conformance]
The given serialization has to satisfy all of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The serialization conforms with the requirements for the \mimetype{text/plain} media type specified in \nisref{IETF/RFC 2046}, section 4.1.3.
\item The serialization shall provide a designated comment construct that can be placed sufficiently\cbs flexibly\cbe as to be uniquely associated with any non-comment construct of the language.  That means, for example, one of the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The serialization provides a construct that indicates the start and end of a comment and may be placed before/after each token that represents a structural element of an OMS.
  \item The serialization provides line-based comments (ranging from an indicated position to the end of a line) but at the same time allows the flexible placement of line breaks before/after each token that represents a structural element of an OMS.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[Standoff markup conformance]
An OMS language is standoff markup conforming with \DOL if one of its serializations conforms with
the requirements for the \mimetype{text/plain} media type specified in \nisref{IETF/RFC 2046},
section 4.1.3.  Note that conformance with \mimetype{text/plain} is a prerequisite for using, for
example, fragment URIs in the style of \nisref{IETF/RFC 5147} for identifying text ranges.
\end{description}

%~\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=fyi]{The latter two seem trivial, but we need them to rule out ad hoc diagrams drawn on a napkin}

Independently from the conformance levels given above, there is the following hierarchy of conformance \wrt CURIEs (compact URIs) as a means of abbreviating IRIs (grammar specified in \cref{c:curies}), listed from highest to lowest:
\begin{description}
\item[Prefixed CURIE conformance] The given serialization allows non-logical symbol identifiers to have the syntactic form of a CURIE, or any subset of the CURIE grammar that allows named prefixes (\syntax{prefix:reference}, where a declaration of \DOL-conformance of a serialization \may redefine the separator character to a character different from \syntax{:}).  A serialization that conforms \wrt\cbs a\cbe prefixed CURIE  is \notrequired to support CURIEs with no prefix: its declaration of \DOL-conformance \may forbid the use of prefixed CURIEs.\\
  Informative comments:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the case that CURIEs are used, a prefix map with multiple prefixes \may be used to map the non-logical symbol identifiers of a native OMS to IRIs in multiple namespaces (\cf \cref{c:map-ids})
  \item The reason for allowing redefinitions of the prefix/reference separator character is that certain serializations of OMS languages may not allow the colon (\syntax{:}) in identifiers.
  \end{itemize}
\item[Non-prefixed names only] The given serialization only supports CURIEs with no prefix, or any subset of the grammar of the \syntax{REFERENCE} nonterminal in the CURIE grammar.\\
  Informative comment: In this case, a binding for the empty prefix \hasto be declared, as this is the only possibility of mapping the identifiers of the native OMS to IRIs, which are located in one flat namespace.
\end{description}

Any conforming serialization of an OMS language shall have a machine-processable description as detailed in \cref{c:conform:description}.

\sclause{Machine-Processable Description of Conforming Languages, Logics, and Serializations}\label{c:conform:description}

\begin{fminipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Rationale}: When a parser processes a \DOL OMS found somewhere, which refers to modules in OMS languages, or includes them verbatim, the parser needs to know what language to expect; further \DOL-supporting software needs to know, e.g., what other \DOL-conforming languages the module in the given OMS language can be translated to.  Therefore,  \cbs all languages/logics/serializations that conform with \DOL are required to describe themselves in a machine-processable way.
\cbe
\end{fminipage}

For any conforming OMS language, logic, and serialization of an OMS language, it is required that it be assigned an HTTP IRI, by which it can be identified.  It is also required that a machine-processable description of this language/logic/serialization\cbs is\cbe retrievable by dereferencing this IRI;\cbs this requirement follows\cbe the linked data principles \nisref{W3C/TR REC-ldp-20150226:2015}. 
\cbs As a minimal requirement, there must be a RDF description conforming to the vocabulary specified in \aref{a:dol-onto}. That description\cbs must\cbe be made available in the RDF/XML serialization\cbe when a client requests content of the MIME type \mimetype{application/rdf+xml}.  Descriptions of the language/logic/serialization in further representations, having different content types, may be provided.%\CLnote[type=fyi]{that opens the door for, \eg, OMDoc}


\sclause{Conformance of a Document With \DOL}\label{c:conform:document}
\begin{fminipage}{\textwidth}
\textbf{Rationale}: for exchanging \DOL documents with other users/tools, nothing that has a formal semantics
must be left implicit.  One \DOL tool may assume that by default any OMS fragments inside a \DOL
document are in some fixed OMS language unless specified otherwise, but another \DOL tool can't be
assumed to understand such \DOL documents.  Defaults are, however, practically convenient, which is
the reason for having the following section about the conformance of an \emph{application}.
\end{fminipage}

A document conforms with \DOL if it contains a \DOL text that is well-formed according to the
grammar.  That means, in particular, that any information related to logics\cbs must\cbe be made explicit
(as foreseen by the \DOL abstract syntax specified in \cref{c:abstract-syntax}), such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item the logic of each OMS that is part of the \DOL document,
\item the translation that is employed between two logics (unless it is one of the default translations specified in \aref{a:graph})
\end{itemize}
However, details about aspects of an OMS that do not have a formal, logic-based semantics, may be
left implicit.  For example, a conforming document may omit explicit references to matching
algorithms that have been employed in obtaining an alignment.

\sclause{Conformance of an Application With \DOL}\label{c:conform:application}

\cbs
In the sequel, ``\DOL abstract syntax'' means an XMI document that
conforms to the \DOL metamodel. Optionally, further representations
(e.g. as JSON) can be supported.
\begin{itemize}
\item
A \emph{parser} is \DOL-conformant if it can parse the \DOL textual syntax and produce the corresponding abstract syntax.
\item
A \emph{printer} is \DOL-conformant if it can read \DOL abstract syntax and produce \DOL textual syntax.
\item
{\DOL}-conformant software that is used to \emph{edit, format or manage} \DOL libraries \hasto be capable of reading and writing \DOL abstract syntax. Moreover, it \hasto meet the requirements for a \DOL-conformant parser if it is able to read in \DOL textual input. It \hasto meet the requirements of a \DOL-conformant printer if it is able to generate \DOL textual output. However, it is also possible that a software for \DOL management will work on the abstract syntax only,\cbs delegating\cbe the reading and generation of \DOL text to external parsers and/or printers.
\item a \emph{static analyzer} is \DOL-conformant if it can compute
  the logic and the signature of an OMS according to the semantics
  defined in section~\ref{c:semantics}. In more detail, a static analyzer
  can have the following capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{simple analysis}: static analysis of \DOL excluding networks and alignments;
\item \emph{full analysis}: static analysis of full \DOL.
\end{itemize}
\item a \emph{transformation tool} is \DOL-conformant if it implements
one (or more) language translations, logic translations, language
projections and/or logic projections.
\item
Software that implements machine \emph{reasoning} about OMS (e.g., theorem proving, approximation)  complies with this specification if and only if it interprets  DOL documents according to the semantics defined in section~\ref{c:semantics}. In more detail, a reasoning tool can have the following capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{simple logical consequence}, i.e.\cbs checking whether all sentences are\cbe marked as \syntax{\%implied} within basic OMS
and extensions are logical consequences
of the enclosing OMS;
\item \emph{structured logical consequence}, i.e.\cbs checking whether all sentences are\cbe marked as \syntax{\%implied} are logical consequences
  of the enclosing OMS and whether all entailments in a DOL document
  have a defined semantics;
\item \emph{interpretation}, i.e.\cbs checking whether\cbe all interpretations in a DOL document have a defined semantics;
\item \emph{simple refinement}, i.e.\cbs checking whether\cbe all
  refinements of OMS in a DOL document have a defined semantics;
\item \emph{full refinement}, i.e.\cbs checking whether\cbe all refinements
  (both of OMS and networks) in a DOL document have a defined
  semantics;
\item \emph{simple conservativity}, i.e.\cbs checking whether\cbe all conservativity
  statements in a DOL document have a defined semantics;
\item \emph{full conservativity}, i.e.\cbs checking whether\cbe all
  statements about conservative, monomorphic, definitional and weakly
  definitional extensions in a DOL document have a defined semantics;
\item \emph{module extraction}, i.e. the ability to compute modules
(typically, a given tool will provide this only for some logics);
\item \emph{approximation}, i.e. the ability to compute approximations
(typically, a given tool will provide this only for some logics
and logic projections);
\item \emph{full \DOL reasoning}, i.e.\cbs checking whether\cbe an DOL
  document has a defined semantics.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\cbe

In practice, \DOL-aware \emph{applications} may also deal with documents that are not conforming 
with \DOL according to the criteria established in \cref{c:conform:document}.  However, an 
application only \emph{conforms} with \DOL if it is capable of producing \DOL-conforming documents as 
its output when requested.

\cbs
\DOL-aware applications \shall support a fixed (possibly extensible) set of OMS languages
conforming with \DOL.
\cbe
  It is, for example, possible that a \DOL-aware application only supports OWL
and Common Logic.  In that case, the application may process documents that mix OWL and Common 
Logic ontologies \emph{without} explicitly declaring the respective logics, as the respective 
syntaxes of OWL and Common Logic can be distinguished by examining the different keywords.  
However, for \DOL conformance, that application has to be capable of exporting documents with 
explicit references to the logics used.

\DOL-aware applications also \cbs \shall \cbe be able to strip \DOL annotations
from embedded fragments in other OMS languages. Moreover, they \cbs \shall \cbe
be able to expand CURIEs into IRIs when requested.

Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a source of information with a

\begin{example}
Consider an ontology involving a concept \texttt{Person},
and another one involving \texttt{Human being}, and an \termref{alignment}
that relates these\cbs two\cbe concepts. In the combination of the ontologies
along the alignment, there is only one concept, representing both
\texttt{Person} and \texttt{Human being}.
\end{example}

 
  \termdefinition{sharing}{property of \termref{OMS symbols} being mapped to the same symbol when computing a \termref{combination} of an \termref{OMS network}.}
 \begin{note}
  Sharing is always relative to a given OMS network that
  relates different OMS. That is, two given OMS symbols
  can share with respect to one OMS network, and not share with respect to some
  other OMS network.

\sclause{Mappings Between OMS}\label{c:mappings}

   \termdefinitionLight{\termref{OMS mapping}\synonym link\subjectfield{OMS}}{relationship between two \termref{OMS}.}
  
%%   \termdefinition{logical OMS mapping}{\termref{OMS mapping} that has a formal, logic-based semantics}
%%   \begin{note}
%%     Logical OMS mappings are given as sets of symbol map items\index{symbol map item}, which generate \emph{signature morphisms}.
%%   \end{note}
%%   \begin{note}
%% Some specific kinds of logical OMS mappings will be introduced below.  
%%   \end{note}

 \termdefinition{symbol map item}{pair of symbols of two OMS, indicating how a symbol from the first OMS is mapped by a signature morphism to a symbol of the second OMS}
 \begin{note}
   A symbol map item is given as $s_1 \mapsto s_2$, where $s_1$ is a symbol from the \emph{source} OMS 
   and $s_2$ is a symbol from the \emph{target}  of the OMS mapping.
 \end{note}
 \begin{note}
   \cbs Similar to \termref{correspondence}.\cbe
 \end{note}

 \termdefinition{signature morphism}{mapping between two signatures,
preserving the structure of the source signature within the target
signature}
 \begin{note}
   \cbs A list of symbol map items induces a signature morphism.\cbe
 \end{note}


  \termdefinitionLight{interpretation\index{interpretation}\synonym view\synonym refinement}{\termref{OMS mapping} that postulates a
specialization relation
 between two \termref{OMS}} along a morphism between their signatures.
  \begin{note}
    An interpretation typically leads to proof obligations, \ie one has to prove that 
  translations of axioms\index{axiom} of the source OMS along the morphism accompanying the interpretation are theorems in the target OMS.
  \end{note}

  \termdefinition{equivalence}
{\termref{OMS mapping} ensuring that two \termref{OMS} share the
  same definable concepts.}
  \begin{note}
    Two OMS are equivalent if they have a common definitional extension.
    The OMS may be written in different OMS languages.
  \end{note}

  \termdefinition{interface signature}{\termref{signature} mediating between an \termref{OMS} and a \termref{module} of that \termref{OMS} in the sense that it contains those non-logical symbols\index{non-logical symbol} that the sentences\index{sentence} of the \termref{module} and the sentences\index{sentence} of the \termref{OMS} have in common.}
  \begin{note}
    Adapted from \cite{CuencaGrauEtAl:ExtractingModulesOntologies2007}.
  \end{note}

  \termdefinition{module relation}{\termref{OMS mapping} stating that one \termref{OMS} is a \termref{module} of the other one.}


\termdefinition{alignment}{an \termref{OMS mapping} expressing a collection of semantic
relations between entities of the two OMS.}
\begin{note}
Alignments consist of correspondences\index{correspondence}, each of which may have a confidence value. If all
confidence values are 1, the alignment can be given a formal, logic-based semantics.
\end{note}

 \termdefinition{correspondence}{relationship between an \termref{non-logical symbol} $e_1$ from an \termref{OMS} $O_1$ and an \termref{non-logical symbol} $e_2$ from an OMS $O_2$, or between an \termref{non-logical symbol} $e_1$ from $O_1$ and a \termref{term} $t_2$ formed from non-logical symbols\index{non-logical symbol} from $O_2$.
  \begin{note}
A correspondence is given as a quadruple 
$(e_1, R, \left\{\begin{array}{c}e_2\\ t_2\end{array}\right\}, c)$,
where $R$ denotes the type of relationship that is asserted to hold between the two non-logical 
symbols/terms, and $0\le c\le 1$ is a confidence value.  $R$ and $c$ may be omitted: When $R$ is 
omitted, it defaults to the equivalence relation, unless another default
relation has been explicitly specified; when $c$ is omitted, it defaults to $1$.}
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
     A confidence value of $1$ does not imply logical equivalence (\cf \cite{KutzEtAl:ChineseWhispers2010} for a worked-out example).
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
     Not all OMS languages implement logical equivalence.  For example, OWL does not implement logical equivalence in general, but separately implements equivalence relations restricted to individuals (\textit{owl:sameAs}), classes (\textit{owl:equivalentClass}) and properties (\textit{owl:equivalentProperty}).
  \end{note}

  \termdefinition{matching}{algorithmic procedure that generates an \termref{alignment} for two given \termref{OMS}.}
  \begin{note}
    For both matching and alignment, see \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0032976,KhanKeet13}.
  \end{note}

 
\termdefinitionLight{\termref{OMS network}\synonym distributed OMS\synonym hyperontology}{\termref{graph} with \termref{OMS} as nodes and OMS mappings\index{OMS mapping} as edges, showing how the OMS are interlinked.}
%\ednote{Is ``hyperontology'' a synonym for ``OMS network'', or rather for
%``heterogeneous OMS''? For the former. ``Hyperontologies. introduce a notion of heterogeneously structured ontology, which also affords distributed networks of ontologies written in
%different formalisms, which we call hyperontologies.'' (from ``Carnap, Goguen, and the Hyperontologies'')}
\begin{note}
 In \cite{MossakowskiTarlecki09}, a distinction between focused and distributed heterogeneous specifications is made. In the terminology of this standard, this is the distinction between \termref{OMS} and OMS networks.
\end{note}
  \begin{note}
    An OMS network is a diagram of OMS in the sense of \termref{category} theory, but different from a diagram
    in the sense of model-driven architecture.
  \end{note}
 \begin{note}
   The links between the nodes of a distributed OMS can be given using interpretations or alignments. Imports between the nodes
   of a  distributed OMS are automatically included in the distributed OMS. By including an interpretation or an alignment in a distributed 
   OMS, the involved nodes are automatically included.
 \end{note}
 \begin{example}
 Consider two ontologies and an \termref{interpretation} between them.  In the distributed OMS of the interpretation there are 
  two nodes, one for each ontology, and one edge from the source ontology to the target ontology of the interpretation. 
 \end{example}

\cbs \termdefinition{category}{a collection of objects with suitable
  morphisms between them.}
\begin{note}
In this standard, objects of a category are usually
\termref{signatures} or \termref{OMS}, and morphisms
are \termref{signature morphisms}, or \termref{OMS mappings}. In principle, no assumption
about the exact nature of objects and morphisms is made.
\end{note}
\begin{note}
The morphisms determine which part of the structure of the objects is
relevant, i.e.\ preserved by morphisms. Hence, objects can be seen as
``sets with structure'', and morphisms as ``structure-preserving
maps''.  However note that not all categories can be obtained in this
way.

\begin{note}
  \cbs The support relations specifies which language supports which
   logics and which serializations, and which language translation
   supports which logic translation or reduction.  
   Moreover, each language has a default \termref{logic} and a default \termref{serialization}.\cbe
\end{note}
\begin{note}
  Although in principle, there can be many heterogeneous environments,

  \begin{example}
    OWL uses the term ``serialization''; the following are standard OWL serializations: OWL
	 functional-style syntax, OWL/XML, OWL Manchester syntax, plus any standard serialization of

Within ISO 19763 and ISO 20943, metamodel interoperability is

models that semantically represent this overlap. Within these
standards, a model is a representation of some aspect of a domain of
interest using a normative modeling facility and modeling
constructs.

The notion of logical interoperability is distinct from the notion of 
interoperability used in 
ISO/IEC 2381-1 Information Technology Vocabulary -- Part 1: Fundamental Terms,
which is restricted to
the capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among

\section{Changes to Adopted OMG Specifications}
This specification does not require or request any change to any other OMG specification. 

\section{How to Read This Specification}
\cbs
The initial five clauses of this specification describe the scope of the specification, determine conformance criteria, provide normative references, define terms and definitions, and introduce symbols that are used in the specification. 
The next three clauses are \emph{informative}. This clause provides some background information, the next two provide a high-level
 summary of usage scenarios and goals (clause \ref{c:goal}) and an overview over the design of
\DOL  (clause \ref{c:design}).
\cbe

\medskip \noindent 
\cbs
Clause \ref{c:abstract-syntax} defines the abstract syntax of \DOL (\emph{normative}) as an SMOF compliant meta model.\cbe
Further, \cbs the same clause also\cbe provides a human friendly text serialization of the abstract syntax of 
\DOL (\emph{normative}). 
\cbs
Annex \ref{a:EBNF} contains the abstract syntax specified using Extended
Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) \cbe
(\emph{informative}).

\medskip \noindent Clause \ref{c:semantics} defines the
model-theoretic semantics of \DOL on the abstract syntax, and also
makes the notion of heterogeneous logical environment (providing
languages, logics and translations) precise (\emph{normative}).

\medskip \noindent Annex \ref{a:dol-onto} specifies an RDF vocabulary for
the terms in clause~\ref{terms-and-defs}, and for OMS languages and
translation that conform with \DOL  (\emph{normative}).

\medskip \noindent Various languages are shown to  conform to \DOL in
informative annexes: OWL2 (annex \ref{a:owl}), Common Logic
(annex~\ref{a:cl}), RDF and RDF Schema (annex~\ref{a:rdfs}), UML class
diagrams (annex~\ref{a:uml-class}, TPTP (annex~\ref{a:TPTP}), and
\CASL (annex \ref{a:casl}).

\medskip \noindent 
Annex \ref{a:graph}  provides a core graph of logics and translations, covering those OMS languages
whose conformance with \DOL is established in the preceding annexes (\emph{informative}). 
Annex \ref{a:ext-graph} extends the graph presented in Annex \ref{a:graph}  by a list of OMS
language whose conformance with \DOL will be established by a registry
(\emph{informative}).

\medskip \noindent 
Annex \ref{a:uses} provides of \DOL texts, which provide examples for all \DOL constructs, which 
are specified in the abstract syntax 
(\emph{informative}).
Annex \ref{a:use-cases} sketches scenarios that outline how \DOL is intended to be applied \cbs (\emph{informative}). For 
each scenario,  a brief description  is provided, and the utilized \DOL features as well as the status of its implementation are listed.\cbe

Annex~\ref{a:tools} gives an overview of available  software tools for
\DOL.  Annex~\ref{a:loc/id} discusses the implementation of a
linked-data compliant IRI scheme used in one of these tools
(\emph{informative}).

\medskip \noindent 
The bibliography contains \ref{a:bibliography} references to the literature that is cited in this document
(\emph{informative}).

\clauseI{Goals and Usage Scenarios} \label{c:goal}


Often, engineering tasks require the use of several different OMS, which represent knowledge about 
a given domain or specify a given system from different perspectives or for different purposes.
(E.g., a software engineer will typically use different OMS to model different aspects of a software
 system,  including its behavior, its components, and its interactions with other systems.)  Further, the OMS are often represented in different OMS languages (e.g., UML class diagrams, OWL, or Common Logic), which may differ in style, expressivity, and different computational properties. 

The use of different OMS within the same context leads to  several 
challenges in the design and deployment of OMS, which have been addressed by current research in 
ontological engineering, formal software specification and formal modeling:
\begin{itemize}
\item How\cbs is it possible\cbe to support shareability and reusability of OMS within the same domain?
\item How\cbs is it possible\cbe to merge OMS in different domains, particularly in the cases 
in which the OMS are axiomatized in different logical languages?
\item What notions of modularity play a role when only part of an OMS is being shared or reused?
\item What are the relationships between versions of an OMS axiomatized in different logical languages?
\end{itemize}


To illustrate these challenges,\cbs this clause presents\cbe a set of usage scenarios that involve the use of more than one OMS. These scenarios address the areas of ontology design, formal specification, and model-driven development. In spite of their many differences, they  all highlight one common theme:  
 the use of multiple OMS leads to interoperability challenges. 
 %There  are ad-hoc solutions to these challenges, and specialized languages and tools are used in practice. 


The purpose of \DOL is to provide  a
standardized representation language, which can be used to represent structured OMS and the relations 
between OMS as part of OMS networks in a semantically well-defined way. Thus, tools that implement \DOL are able to integrate different OMS into a coherent whole, thereby enabling users of \DOL to overcome the different kind of interoperability issues that\cbs are\cbe illustrated by the usage scenarios in this clause.  

\cbs
Most of the following subsections are illustrated with sample \DOL
libraries. These are always written in \DOL, see the \DOL Text
Serialization in clause ~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}. Naturally, they also
contain parts written in different OMS languages (e.g.\ \OWL), the
syntax of which is not described in this standard, but in other
standard documents.
\cbe

%\section{Problem Statement}	
%Logical languages are used in several fields of computing for the development of formal, machine-processable texts that carry a formal semantics. Among those fields are 1) ontologies formalizing domain knowledge, 2) formal models of systems, and 3) the formal specification of systems. Relevant languages include, but are not limited to:
%?	the ontology languages OWL [OWL2], RDF [RDF, RDF-Semantics, RDF Semantic [RDFS],
%?	the modeling language UML [UML] (fUML [FUML] equips part of UML with a formal semantics)
%?	general-purpose first-order languages: TPTP FOF, TPTP TFF [TPTP], F-logic [FLogic], Common Logic [CL]
%?	more specialized specification logics like modal logics, temporal logics, higher-order logics, TPTP THF [TPTP]
%?	more complex fully-fledged specification languages like VDM [VDM], B [B], Z [Z], CASL [CASL]
%?	the rule languages in the RIF [RIF] (Rule Interchange Format) and RuleML [RuleML] families of languages, as well as in OMG PRR (at least as far they are based on monotonic logics; for non-monotonic logics, see the non-mandatory requirements section)
%
%This great diversity of languages is partly justified by the requirements of the domains and application areas they target, as reflected in the different technical properties of the languages. However, this diversity makes interoperability among ontologies, models, specifications and systems that are implemented using these languages more difficult. Moreover, it is not possible to find a single logical language into which all others can be mapped; rather, it is necessary to adopt a heterogeneous approach to interoperability. The submission team for the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) reached a similar conclusion years ago, and elected to represent the abstract syntax of several of these languages rather than attempt to develop a new language that could be mapped to each of them. Ontologies, specifications and models will (for the purpose of this document) henceforth be abbreviated as OMS, if all three can be treated in the same way. Note that the underlying logical notion is that of a logical theory.(All terms introduced in italics are defined in the glossary below.)
%
%Related to the diversity of languages, there is considerable variation in the operations and relations on OMS that are in use today:
%?	matching and alignment of different ontologies covering one domain. Note that the task of finding of alignments is outside the scope of this RFP; proposals are sought that will provide a metalanguage for documenting such alignments only.
%?	interpretation and refinement of OMS
%?	module extraction -- selection of small parts (suiting particular purposes) of large OMS
%?	approximation ? enabling modeling in an expressive language, with simulation and reasoning designed for performance, transaction-oriented, real-time (or near-real time), lighter weight languages 
%?	querying
%?	ontology-based database access/data management
%?	bridges between different axiomatizations, e.g. distributed description logics, E-connections
%?	translations of OMS to other languages
%?	combinations of OMS
%
%Heterogeneity can be seen at both the level of the logical languages as well as within the OMS themselves. There are many domains in which multiple OMS exist, in some cases axiomatized in the same language, and in other cases axiomatized in different logical languages. This leads to several challenges in the design and deployment of OMS, which have been addressed by current research in ontological engineering, formal software specification and formal modeling:
%
%?	How can we support sharability and reusability of OMS within the same domain?
%
%?	How can we merge OMS in different domains, particularly in the cases in which the OMS are axiomatized in different logical languages?
%
%?	What notions of modularity play a role when only part of an OMS is being shared or reused?
%
%?	What are the relationships between versions of an OMS axiomatized in different logical languages?
%
%These challenges can be illustrated by the following set of use cases:

\section{Use Case Onto-1: Interoperability Between OWL and FOL Ontologies}

In order to achieve interoperability during ontology development it is often necessary to describe 
concepts in a language more expressive than OWL.  Therefore, it is common practice to informally 
annotate OWL ontologies with FOL axioms (e.g., Keet's mereotopological ontology [Part-Whole], 
Dolce Lite [Dolce-lite], BFO-OWL). OWL is used because of better tool support, FOL because of 
greater expressiveness. However, relegating FOL axioms to  informal annotations means that these 
are not available for machine processing.  Another example of this problem is the following: For 
formally representing concept schemes (including taxonomies, thesauri and classification schemes) 
and provenance information there are the two W3C standards SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization 
System; \nisref{W3C/TR REC-skos-reference:2009}) and PROV, as well as \ednote{CL: Did we mean something like “ISO 12345” here, i.e.\ some 
specific ISO standard that we reference by number? Terry: (re: footnote 29) Probably the family headed by ISO 11179 Information Technology -- Metadata registries (MDR) (http://metadata-stds.org/)
The 11179 standard is a multipart standard that includes the following parts:·         '          Part 1: Framework
·         Part 2: Classification
·         Part 3: Registry metamodel and basic attributes
·         Part 4: Formulation of data definitions
·         Part 5: Naming and identification principles
·         Part 6: Registration
Other standards in the series are 
ISO 19583  Concepts and usage of metadata
ISO 19763-* Metamodel interoperability
ISO 19773   Metadata modules
ISO 24706   Metadata for technical stds
ISO 24707   Common logic}ISO and other domain-specific  standards for 
metadata representation. The semantics for the SKOS and PROV languages are largely specified as OWL 
ontologies; however, as OWL cannot capture the full semantics, the rest is specified using some 
informal first-order rules. In other words, valid instance models that use SKOS or PROV may be 
required to satisfy both OWL and FOL axioms. When solving reasoning tasks over either SKOS or PROV 
ontologies, OWL reasoners are not able to consider the  FOL axioms. Hence, the information 
contained in these axioms is lost.

\DOL allows the user to replace such informal annotations by formal axioms in a suitable ontology 
language. The relation between the \OWL ontology and the FOL axioms is that of a heterogeneous 
import. In the result, both the \OWL and the FOL axioms are amenable to, e.g., automated consistency 
checking and theorem proving. Hence, all available information can be used in the reasoning process.
For example, the ontology below extends the \OWL definition of \texttt{isProperPartOf} as an asymmetric relation
with a first-order axiom (in Common Logic) asserting that the relation is also transitive.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\small\ttfamily,language=dolText,morekeywords={logic,ontology,props,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists},escapechar=@,mathescape]
logic CommonLogic
ontology Parthood =
ObjectProperty: isProperPartOf  
  Characteristics: Asymmetric  
  SubPropertyOf: isPartOf 
with translation trans:SROIQtoCL
then
  (if (and (isProperPartOf x y) (isProperPartOf y z)) 
        (isProperPartOf x z))
\end{lstlisting}
\OWL can express transitivity, but not together with asymmetry.

\section{Use Case Onto-2: Ontology Integration by Means of a Foundational Ontology}
One major use case for ontologies in industry is to achieve interoperability and data integration. 
However if ontologies are developed independently and used  within the same domain, the 
differences between the ontologies may actually impede interoperability. One strategy to avoid this 
problem is the use of a shared  foundational ontology (e.g., DOLCE or BFO), which can be used to 
harmonize different domain ontologies. One challenge for this approach is that foundational 
ontologies typically rely on expressive ontology languages (e.g., Common Logic), while domain 
ontologies may be represented in languages that are optimized for performance (e.g., OWL EL). For 
this reason, currently the role of the foundational ontology is mainly to provide a conceptual 
framework that may be reused by the  domain ontologies; further, watered-down versions of the 
foundational ontologies in OWL (like DOLCE-lite or the OWL version of BFO) are used as basis for 
the  development of domain ontologies, be this as is, in an even less expressive version (e.g., a 
DOLCE-lite in OWL 2 EL), or only a relevant subset thereof (e.g., only the branch of endurants). A 
sample orchestration of interactions between the foundational and domain ontologies in various 
languages is depicted in Figure \ref{f:DOL-mapping} below.

DOL  provides the framework for integrating different domain ontologies, aligning these to 
foundational ontologies [Alignment1-2] and combining the aligned ontologies into a coherent 
integrated ontology -- even across different ontology languages. Thus, \DOL  enables ontology 
developers to utilize the complete, and most expressive, foundational ontologies for ontology 
integration and validation purposes. 

The foundational ontology (FO) repository Repository of Ontologies for MULtiple USes (ROMULUS)\footnote{See \url{http://www.thezfiles.co.za/ROMULUS/home.html}}
contains alignments\index{alignment} between a number of foundational ontologies, expressing semantic relations between the aligned
entities. \cbs For this use-case three such ontologies are considered,\cbe containing spatial and temporal concepts: DOLCE\footnote{See \url{http://www.loa.istc.cnr.it/DOLCE.html}}, GFO\footnote{See \url{http://www.onto-med.de/ontologies/gfo/}} and BFO\footnote{See \url{http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/}}, and present alignments between them 
using \DOL syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,language=dolText,morekeywords={props,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,distributed,from},escapechar=@,mathescape]

           bfo: <http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/>
           
        )%
logic OWL

alignment DolceLite2BFO :
  dolce:DOLCE-Lite.owl
  to
  bfo:1.1 =
 endurant = IndependentContinuant,
 physical-endurant = MaterialEntity,
 physical-object = Object,   perdurant = Occurrent,
 process = Process,          quality = Quality,
 spatio-temporal-region = SpatiotemporalRegion,
 temporal-region = TemporalRegion,  space-region = SpatialRegion

alignment DolceLite2GFO :
  dolce:DOLCE-Lite.owl to gfo:gfo.owl =
 	particular = Individual, endurant = Presential,
 	physical-object = Material_object, amount-of-matter = Amount_of_substrate,
 	perdurant = Occurrent, 	quality = Property,
 	time-interval = Chronoid, generic-dependent < necessary_for,
 	part < abstract_has_part, part-of < abstract_part_of,
 	proper-part  <	 has_proper_part,  	proper-part-of  < proper_part_of,
 	generic-location < occupies, 	generic-location-of < occupied_by

alignment BFO2GFO :
  bfo:1.1 to gfo:gfo.owl =
	Entity = Entity, Object = Material_object,
	ObjectBoundary  = Material_boundary, Role < Role ,
 	Occurrent = Occurrent, 	Process = Process, Quality = Property
 	SpatialRegion 	= Spatial_region, TemporalRegion = Temporal_region 	
\end{lstlisting}


\cbs \DOL can be used to combine ontologies, while taking into account the semantic dependencies given by the alignments. In the following example the ontology \lstinline{Space} is defined as a combination of three different ontologies (BFO, GFO, DolceLite) along three alignments. \cbe

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,language=dolText,morekeywords={props,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,distributed,from},escapechar=@,mathescape]
ontology Space =
 combine BFO2GFO, DolceLite2GFO, DolceLite2BFO
\end{lstlisting} 

\section{Use Case Onto-3: Module Extraction From Large Ontologies}\label{onto-3}
Especially in the biomedical domain, ontologies tend to become very large (e.g., SNOMED CT, FMA) 
with over 100000 concepts and relationships. Yet, none of these ontologies covers all aspects of a 
domain, and frequently provide coverage at various levels of specificity, with excessive detail in 
some areas that may not be required for all usage scenarios. Often, for a given knowledge 
representation problem in industry, only relevant knowledge from two such large reference 
ontologies needs to be integrated, so a comprehensive integration would be both unfeasible and 
unwieldy. Hence, parts (modules) of these ontologies are obtained by selecting the concepts and 
relationships (roles) relevant for the intended application. An integrated version will then be 
based on these excerpts from the original ontologies (i.e., modules). For example, the Juvenile 
Rheumatoid Arthritis ontology JRAO has been created using modules from the NCI thesaurus and GALEN 
medical ontology. (See \ednote{CL: can we please have a vector graphic here?}\fref{JRAO}) \DOL  
supports the description of such subsets (modules) of ontologies, as well as their alignment and 
integration.

end

end
\end{lstlisting}
 


\section{Use Case Onto-4: Interoperability Between Closed-World Data and Open-World Metadata}
Data collection has become easier and much more widespread over the years. This data has to be 
assigned a meaning somehow, which occurs traditionally in the  form of metadata annotations. For 
instance, consider geographical datasets derived from satellite data and raw sensor readings. 
Current implementations in, e.g., ecological economics\cite{bagstad_aries_2011} require manual 
annotation of datasets with the information relevant for their processes. While there have been 
attempts to standardize such information\cite{european_comission_inspire_2014}, metadata for 
datasets of simulation results are more difficult to standardize. Moreover, it is 
resource-consuming to link the data to the metadata, to ensure the metadata itself is of good 
quality and consistent, and to actually exploit the metadata when querying the data for data 
analysis. 

The data is usually represented in a database or RDF triple store, which work with a \termref{closed world assumption} on the dataset, and are not expressive enough to 
incorporate the metadata `background knowledge', such as the conditions for validity of the physical laws in the model of the object of observation. These metadata 
require a more expressive language, such as OWL or Common Logic, which operate under an open-world semantics. However, it is unfeasible to translate the 
whole large dataset into OWL or first-order logic. To `meet in the middle', it is possible to declare bridge rules (i.e., a mapping layer) that can link the metadata to 
the data. This approach can be used for intelligent data analysis that combines the data and metadata through querying the system. It enables the analysis of the 
data on the conceptual layer, instead of users having to learn the SQL/SPARQL query languages and how the data is stored. There are various tools and theories 
to realize this, which is collectively called Ontology-Based Data Access/Management, see also [OBDA].

The languages for representing the metadata or ontology, for representing the bridge rules or mapping assertions, and for representing the data are different yet 
they need to be orchestrated and handled smoothly in the system, be this for data analytics for large enterprises, for formulating policies, or in silico biology in the 
sciences. 

\DOL  provides the framework for expressing such bridge rules in a systematic way, maintaining these, and building tools for them. 


\section{Use Case Onto-5: Verification of Rules Translating Dublin Core Into PROV}
The Dublin Core Metadata terms, which have been formalized as an RDF Schema vocabulary, developed initially by the digital library community, are less 
comprehensive but more widely used than PROV (cf. Use Case Onto-1). The rules for translating Dublin Core to the OWL subset of PROV (and, with restrictions, 
vice versa) are not known to yield valid instances of the PROV data model, i.e. they are not known to yield OWL ontologies consistent with respect to the OWL axioms that 
capture part of the PROV data model. This may disrupt systems that would like to reason about the provenance of an entity, and thus the assessment of the 
entity's quality, reliability or trustworthiness.
The Dublin Core to PROV ontology translation%
\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-dc-20130430/}}
  is expressed partly by a symbol mapping and partly by FOL rules. These FOL rules are implemented by CONSTRUCT patterns in the SPARQL RDF query language.%
\footnote{E.g., \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-dc-20130430/\#dct-creator}} 
SPARQL has a formal specification of the evaluation semantics of its algebraic expressions, which is different from the model-theoretic semantics of the OWL and RDF Schema languages; nevertheless SPARQL CONSTRUCT is a popular and immediately executable syntax for expressing translation rules between ontologies in RDF-based languages in a subset of FOL.
\DOL  not only supports the reuse of the existing Dublin Core RDF Schema and PROV OWL ontologies as modules of a distributed ontology (= OMS network), but it is also able to support the description of the FOL translation rules in a sufficiently expressive ontology language, e.g. Common Logic, and thus enable formal verification of the translation from Dublin Core to PROV.


\section{Use Case Spec-1: Modularity of Specifications}\label{spec-1}
Often specifications become so large that it is necessary to structure
them in a modular way, for human readability and maintainability, and for more efficient tool support. The lack of a standard for such
modular structuring hinders interoperability among different
development efforts and the reuse of specifications.  \DOL provides a
notion of structured modular specification that is equally applicable
to all \DOL-conforming logical languages.

Structuring pays off even for small specifications. For example, it makes
structuring a simple specification of sorting lists in the 
following way enhances both readability and potential for re-use
of specifications:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,language=dolText,morekeywords={sort, ops, refinement, free,spec type, assoc, unit,props,op,spec,refined, via,generated, then,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,distributed,from},escapechar=@,mathescape]	
library Sorting

%% refinement from abstract sorting to insert sort

logic CASL
%right_assoc __::__
spec TotalOrder =
  sort Elem
  pred __<=__ : Elem * Elem
  forall x,y,z : Elem
  . x <= x                         %(reflexive)%
  . x <= z if x <= y /\ y <= z     %(transitive)%
  . x = y if x <= y /\ y <= x      %(antisymmetric)%
  . x <= y \/ y <= x               %(dichotomous)%
end

spec Nat =
  free type Nat ::= 0 | suc(Nat)
end

spec List =
  Nat
then
  sort Elem
  free type List ::= [] | __::__(Elem; List)
  op count : Elem * List -> Nat
  forall x,y : Elem; L : List
  . count(x,[]) = 0
  . count(x,x :: L) = suc(count(x,L))
  . count(x,y :: L) = count(x,L) if not x=y
end

spec Sorting =
  TotalOrder and List
then
  preds is_ordered : List;
        permutation : List * List
  vars x,y:Elem; L,L1,L2:List
  . is_ordered([])
  . is_ordered(x::[])
  . is_ordered(x::y::L) <=> x<=y /\ is_ordered(y::L)
  . permutation(L1,L2) <=> (forall x:Elem . count(x,L1) = count(x,L2))
then
  op sorter : List->List
  var L:List
  . is_ordered(sorter(L))
  . permutation(L,sorter(L))
hide is_ordered, permutation
end
\end{lstlisting}

In the last step, the structuring operation of hiding is used to
restrict the specification to an export interface:\cbs 
 predicates \texttt{is\_ordered} and \texttt{permutation} are hidden,\cbe because they
are only auxiliary and need not be implemented.


\section{Use Case Spec-2: Specification Refinements}\label{spec-2}
Formal software and hardware development methods are often used to
ensure the correct function of systems which have safety-critical
requirements or which may not be easily accessible for repair or
replacement.  Examples of such requirements can be found in
safety-critical areas such as medical systems, or in the automotive,
avionics and aerospace industries, as well as in components used by
those industries such as in microprocessor design.

Typically, a requirement specification is refined into a
design specification and then an implementation, often involving
several intermediate steps (see, e.g. the V-model [V-model], although
this does not require formal specification).  There are numerous
specification formalisms in use, including the OMG's SysML language;
moreover, often during development, the formalism needs to be changed
(e.g. from a specification to a programming language, or from a
temporal logic to a state machine). For each of these formalisms,
notions of refinement have been defined and implemented. However, the
lack of a standardized, logically sound language and methodology for
such refinement hinders interoperability among different development
efforts and the reuse of refinements.  \DOL provides the capability to
represent refinement that is equally applicable to all \DOL-conforming
logical languages, and that covers at least the most relevant of the
industrial use cases of specification refinement.

A simple example is the refinement of the (purely declarative) sorting
specification from use case in section \ref{spec-1} into a specification of a particular sorting
algorithm (for simplicity,\cbs insert sort is used for demonstration):\cbe

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,language=dolText,morekeywords={sort, ops, refinement, free,spec type, assoc, unit,props,op,spec,refined, via,generated, then,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,distributed,from},escapechar=@,mathescape]	
spec InsertSort = 
  TotalOrder and List
then
  ops insert : Elem*List -> List;
      insert_sort : List->List
  vars x,y:Elem; L:List
  . insert(x,[]) = x::[]
  . insert(x,y::L) = x::insert(y,L) when x<=y else y::insert(x,L)
  . insert_sort([]) = []
  . insert_sort(x::L) = insert(x,insert_sort(L))
 hide insert
end

refinement InsertSortCorrectness =
   Sorting refined via sorter |-> insert_sort to InsertSort
end
\end{lstlisting}
Note that hiding is essential here to make the signatures of
both specifications compatible.\cbs If  the
predicates \texttt{is\_ordered} and \texttt{permutation}
had not been hidden\cbe in the \texttt{Sorting} specification, a refinement would
not have been possible, since \texttt{InsertSort} does not
implement these predicates (and it would be rather artificial
to add an implementation for them).

\medskip

Refinements can be composed. A simple example below illustrates this
by expressing that natural numbers with addition form a monoid, and
that natural numbers can be efficiently represented for implementation
as lists of binary digits, together with several equivalent ways of
composing these refinements.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,language=dolText,morekeywords={sort, ops, refinement, free,spec type, assoc, unit,props,op,spec,refined, via,generated, then,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,distributed,from},escapechar=@,mathescape]	
spec Monoid =
 sort Elem
 ops 0 : Elem;
         __+__ : Elem * Elem -> Elem, assoc, unit 0
end

\section{Use Case Model-1: Consistency Among UML Diagrams of Different Types}
\label{model-1}

A typical UML model involves diagrams of different types. Such UML models may have intrinsic errors because diagrams of different types may specify conflicting 
requirements. Typical questions that arise in this context are, e.g.,

\begin{itemize}
\item whether the multiplicities in a class diagram are consistent with each other;
\item whether the attributes and operations in a state machine are
available in a class diagram;
\item	  whether the sequential composition of actions in an interaction diagram is justified by an accompanying OCL specification;
\item 	whether cooperating state machines comply with pre-/post-conditions and invariants;
\item 	whether the behavior prescribed in an interaction diagram is realizable by several state machines cooperating according to a composite structure diagram.
\end{itemize}
Such questions are currently hard to answer in a systematic manner. One method to answer these questions and find such errors is a check for semantic 
consistency. Under some restrictions, the proof of semantic consistency can be (at least partially) performed using model-checking tools like Hugo/RT \cite{knapp-wuttke:models06wsh:2007}. 
Once a formal semantics for the different diagram types has been chosen (see, e.g. \cite{knapp-mossakowski-roggenbach:corr:2014}), it is possible to use \DOL to specify in which 
sense the diagrams need to be consistent, and check this by suitable tools.


\ssclause{The ATM Example}
\label{sec:atm-example}

\cbs The ATM example, which illustrates model-driven development using UML,
is taken from \cite{knapp-mossakowski-roggenbach:corr:2014}.  The example involves\cbe
the design of a traditional automatic teller machine (ATM) connected
to a bank. For simplicity, \cbs the example focuses
 on the ATM's processing of card and PIN entry actions.\cbe  
After entering the card, one has three
trials for entering the correct PIN (which is checked by the
bank). After three unsuccessful trials the card is kept.

\caption{ATM example}\label{fig:atm-example}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:interaction} shows a possible \emph{interaction}
between an \uml{atm} and a \uml{bank} object, which consists of
four messages: the \uml{atm} requests the \uml{bank} to \uml{verify}
if a card and PIN number combination is valid, in the first case the
\uml{bank} requests to reenter the PIN, in the second case the
verification is successful.  This interaction presumes that the system
has an \uml{atm} and a \uml{bank} as objects. This can, e.g., be
ensured by a \emph{composite structure diagram}, see
Fig.~\ref{fig:system}, which -- among other things -- specifies the
objects in the initial system state.  Furthermore, it specifies that
the communication between \uml{atm} and \uml{bank} goes through the
two ports \uml{bankCom} and \uml{atmCom} linked by a connector.  The
communication protocol on this connector is captured with a
\emph{protocol state machine}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:psm}.  The protocol
state machine fixes in which order the messages \uml{verify},
\uml{verified}, \uml{reenterPIN}, and \uml{markInvalid} between
\uml{atm} and \uml{bank} may occur.  Figure~\ref{fig:class} provides
structural information in form of an interface specifying what is
provided at the \uml{userCom} port of the \uml{atm} instance. An
interface is a set of operations that other model elements have to
implement. In our case, the interface is described in a \emph{class
  diagram}. Here, the operation \uml{keepCard} is enriched with the
OCL constraint \uml{trialsNum >= 3}, which refines its semantics:
\uml{keepCard} can only be invoked if the OCL constraints holds.

Finally, the dynamic behavior of the \uml{atm} object is specified by
the \emph{behavioral state machine} shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:state-machine}. The machine consists of five states
including \uml{Idle}, \uml{CardEntered}, etc.  Beginning in the
initial \uml{Idle} state, the user can \emph{trigger} a state change
by entering the \uml{card}. This has the \emph{effect} that the
parameter \uml{c} from the \uml{card} event is assigned to the
\uml{cardId} in the \uml{atm} object (parameter names are not shown on
triggers). Entering a \uml{PIN} triggers another transition to
\uml{PINEntered}.  Then the ATM requests verification from the bank
using its \uml{bankCom} port.  The transition to \uml{Verifying} uses
a \emph{completion event}: No explicit trigger is declared and the
machine autonomously creates such an event whenever a state is
completed, i.e., all internal activities of the state are finished (in
our example there are no such activities).  If the interaction with
the bank results in \uml{reenterPIN}, and the \emph{guard}
\uml{trialsNum < 3} is true, the user can again enter a \uml{PIN}.


The ATM example in Fig.~\ref{fig:atm-example} consists of five different
models, which naturally form a network. Coherence of this network
is expressed as its consistency.\cbs 
It is assumed that XMI representations\cbe of the
relevant UML models have been stored at

\section{Use Case Model-2: Refinements Between UML Diagrams of Different Types, and Their Reuse}
\label{model-2}

A problem is a lack of reusability of refinements: Consider a controller for an elevator, which is specified with a UML protocol state machine, enriched with UML 
sequence diagrams and OCL constraints. Assume further that this model is not directly implemented, but first refined to a UML behavior state machine (which then 
can be automatically or semi-automatically transformed into some implementation using standard UML tools). However, there is no standardized language to 
express, document and maintain the refinement relation itself (UML only allows very simple refinements, namely between state machines). This hinders both the 
reuse of such refinements in different contexts, as well as the interoperability of tools proving such refinements to be correct. \DOL  
addresses these problems by providing a standardized notation with formal semantics for such refinements. Refinements expressed in this language could, e.g., be 
parameterized and reused in different contexts.

\cbs This can be illustrated based on the state
machine of the \uml{atm}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:state-machine}, which is a  
refinement of the protocol state machine in Fig.~\ref{fig:psm}. This can be stated as follows in \DOL.\cbe 
\footnote{\cbs  It is assumed that XMI representations of the relevant UML models have been 
stored at \url{http://www.example.org/uml/},
e.g.\ \url{http://www.example.org/uml/atm.xmi} \cbe} 


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily,language=dolText,morekeywords={props,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,distributed,refinement,library,via},escapechar=@,mathescape]
refinement abstract_to_concrete_atm =
  psm refined via translation psm2atm to 
       {  atm with Idle |-> Idle, CardEntered |-> Idle, 
                   PINEntered |-> Idle, Verified |-> Idle, 
                   Verifying |-> Verifying 
          hide card, PIN   }
end
\end{lstlisting}

The refinement uses an abstraction of the \uml{atm}, expressed by the
translation via symbol map \texttt{Idle |-> Idle, CardEntered |-> Idle, PINEntered |-> Idle, Verified |-> Idle, Verifying |-> Verifying}, resulting in a two-state machine. Moreover, some detail of the \uml{atm} is hidden using
\syntax{hide}. Then, the protocol state machine can be refined to
the thus abstracted \uml{atm}.

\section{Use Case Model-3: Coherent Semantics for Multi-Language Models}
\label{model-3}
	
Often a single problem area within a given domain must be represented using several formalisms, e.g., because of user community requirements, expressiveness or tool support 
and usage. 
Typically the different representations are written by different people using formalisms that are based on different logics. Thus, it is a challenge to maintain 
consistency across the different representations. 
The need for the use of multiple OMS languages, even within the OMG community, is also reflected by the OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM), which 
provides a number of syntactic transformations between such languages.
One example is the OMG Date-Time Vocabulary (DTV). DTV has been formulated in different languages, each of which addresses different audiences:
\begin{itemize}
\item	 SBVR: business users
\item 	UML (class diagrams and OCL): software implementors
\item 	OWL: ontology developers and users
\item 	Common Logic: (foundational) ontology developers and users
\end{itemize}
With \DOL, one can, e.g.,
\begin{itemize}
\item 	formally relate the different formalizations used for DTV, relate the different formalizations using translations,
\item 	check consistency across the different formalizations (using suitable tools),
\item 	extract sub-modules covering specific aspects, and
\item 	specify the OWL version to be an approximation of the Common Logic version (using a heterogeneous interpretation of OMS).
\end{itemize}
Note that the last point does not specify what information is lost in the approximation. Indeed, \DOL provides the means to specify requirements on the approximation, e.g., that it maximally preserves the information. 

Coming to a \DOL example,
a model like the ATM model developed in section \ref{sec:atm-example} typically is part of an
application context that also contains some common terminology.
This terminology often is specified by an ontology, and then
it is desirable to relate the model to the ontology. Consider
the following financial ontology fragment:

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily,language=dolText,morekeywords={props,ObjectProperty,Class,DisjointUnionOf,SubClassOf,DisjointWith, Irreflexive, Characteristics,Transitive,Asymmetric,SubPropertyOf,DisjointClasses,EquivalentTo,inverse,only,forall,iff,if,or,exists,sort,ops,in,approximate,extract},escapechar=@,mathescape]
ontology myTaxonomy =
  ObjectProperty: owns 
    Characteristics: Irreflexive, Asymmetric

  Class: FinancialIntermediary
    SubClassOf: CorporatePerson 
  Class: CorporatePerson

  Class: ImmaterialEntity
    DisjointWith: MaterialEntity
    SubClassOf: has_part only ImmaterialEntity
  Class: Livestock 	
    SubClassOf: MaterialEntity 
...
end
\end{lstlisting}

\cbs To relate this ontology with the ATM model, 
various aspects need to be taken care of:\cbe
\begin{itemize}
  \item Translating into shared language \cbs (in this case, Common Logic)\cbe
  \item Unifying terminology (Bank vs. FinancialIntermediary)
  \item Connecting related concepts (bank.owns.ATM vs. owns)
  \item Removing irrelevant parts (livestock) 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\cbs
In this section, several use cases have been introduced. They illustrate many aspects of DOL and its usefulness in many situations in which different OMS artifacts might be leveraged and augmented to produce broader or more tractable models, ontologies, and specifications.

 \DOL has been designed to support of a wide range of formalisms and
provides the ability to specify the basis for formal interoperability even among heterogeneous OMS and OMS networks. \DOL enables the solutions of the problems described in the use cases above. It also enables the development of DOL documents, tools and workflows that 
allow  a better exchange and reuse of OMS. Eventually, this will also lead to better, easier developed and maintained systems based on these OMS.

The next sections present the metalanguage \DOL{}; in particular, the syntax and the model-theoretic semantics. Further, various features of \DOL will be discussed, which  are based on  best practices of modularity  across
 the three areas of ontology design, formal 
specification, and model-driven development.

%\section{\DOL design}
\label{c:design:overview}

\cbs It provides an overview of \cbe the most important and innovative language
constructs of \DOL. Details can be found in clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

\section{\DOL in a Nutshell}

As the usage scenarios in clause \ref{c:goal} illustrate, the use of multiple OMS may lead to lack 
 of interoperability. The goal of \DOL is to enable users to overcome these interoperability issues by providing a language for representing 
structured OMS and the relations between OMS as part of an OMS network in a semantically well-defined way. One particular challenge that needs to be
addressed is that OMS are written in a wide variety of OMS languages, which differ in style, 
expressivity and logical properties. 
\cbs To address this diversity this specification does \textbf{not} propose a 
``universal'' language that is intended to subsume all the others. Quite the opposite, the authors of this specification embrace
the pluralism of OMS languages, and the purpose of \DOL is to provide means (on a sound and formal semantic basis) to\cbe 
 compare and integrate OMS written in different formalisms. Thus, \DOL is not `yet-another-modeling
language', but a meta-language that is used on top of existing OMS languages. 

The major functions of \DOL are the following: 
\begin{itemize}
		\item \DOL allows the use of OMS in other OMS languages (e.g., UML class diagrams, \CASL, 
		OWL, Common Logic) without requiring any changes. These are called \emph{native OMS}. \cbs A native OMS is serialized in a \emph{native document}. \cbe  
		\item \DOL provides for defining new, \emph{structured OMS} based on existing OMS.\footnote{Native OMS can also use the structuring constructs from their OMS language. However, these structuring constructs are often quite limited, and moreover, they differ from OMS language to OMS language.} \DOL provides a number of operations for this purpose; e.g.,
		it is possible to define a structured OMS $C$ as the union of an OWL
		ontology $A$ and a Common Logic ontology $B$.
		\item \DOL provides for defining connections between two OMS by using 
		\emph{OMS mappings}. \DOL provides a variety of mappings; e.g.,  one can align terminology 
		between different OMS or specify that some OMS is an extension of another. A set of OMS
		and OMS mappings may form together an \emph{OMS network}.
		\item Native OMS inherit their semantics from the underlying OMS languages. The \DOL
		 operations for defining structured OMS, 
		OMS mappings, and OMS networks have a declarative model-theoretic semantics, which is 
		 defined in \cref{c:semantics}.  
\end{itemize}
 
\cbs Each of these functions corresponds to a syntactic category in \DOL: native OMS, structured
 OMS, OMS mappings, and OMS networks. They (together with importations) form the items in a
\emph{\DOL library}, and are, in this sense, the most important metaclasses of \DOL. 
%The syntax of \DOL roughly follows these functions.
%Native OMS, the various kind of structured OMS, OMS mappings, and OMS networks are the most important metaclasses   of \DOL.

\section{Features of \DOL}\label{c:req:overview}

\DOL is a language enabling OMS interoperability. 
\DOL is
\begin{description}
\item[free] \DOL is freely available for unrestricted use.
\item[generally applicable] \DOL is neither restricted to OMS in a specific domain, nor to foundational OMS, nor to OMS represented in a specific OMS language, nor to OMS stored in any specific repositories.
\item[open] \DOL supports mapping, integrating, and annotating OMS across arbitrary internet locations.  It makes use of existing open standards wherever suitable.  The criteria for extending \DOL (see next item) are transparent and explicit.
\item[extensible] \DOL provides a framework into which any existing, and, desirably, any future OMS language can be plugged.
\end{description}
\DOL is applicable to any OMS language that has a formal, logic-based semantics or a semantics defined by translation to another OMS language with such a formal semantics. The annotation framework of \DOL is additionally applicable to the non-logical constructs of such languages. This \IS specifies formal criteria for establishing the conformance of an OMS language with \DOL.  The annex establishes the conformance of a number of relevant OMS languages with \DOL; a registry shall offer the possibility to add further (\cbs including\cbe non-standardized) languages. 

\DOL provides syntactic constructs for structuring OMS regardless of the logic their sentences are formalized in. 
Since \DOL is a meta-language,  it \textit{inherits} the logical language aspects of conforming OMS languages.  It is possible to literally include sentences expressed in such OMS languages in a \DOL OMS.


\DOL provides an initial vocabulary for expressing relations in correspondences (as part of alignments between OMS).  Additionally, it provides a means of reusing relation types defined externally of this \IS.
\DOL does not provide an annotation vocabulary, i.e.\ it neither provides annotation properties nor datatypes to be used with literal annotation objects.
% Instead, an informative annex recommends existing annotation vocabularies for use with \DOL.
%\CLnote[type=q-all]{We need to revise this following the agreement to drop the XML and RDF serializations.}In the interest of wide applicability and tool support, \DOL  supports multiple alternative serializations.  In particular, there is a text serialization targeting human readers and writers, as well as serializations optimized for machine processability.
%The \textbf{text serialization} in particular offers a syntax for abbreviating identifiers of resources within OMS in a way that does not require authors to write down their full global identifiers.
%An OMS implemented in \DOL can comprise parts formalized in any OMS language; any serialization of \DOL can literally include such parts, regardless of the OMS language serialization they have been written in. \todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201109200256+02'00',type=fyi]{advanced namespacing is the solution that addresses this requirement} Additionally, an OMS implemented in \DOL can refer to any external OMS formalized in any OMS language, as long as they can be identified in a globally unique way.
%Existing OMS in existing XML serializations (\eg XCL) or text serializations (\eg OWL Manchester Syntax) validate as \DOL OMS with a minimum amount of syntactic adaptation. Existing OMS files/documents are usable in a \DOL context without the need for modification.


%\DOL does not provide a new elementary OMS language, but provides a
% layer to be used on top of existing elementary OMS languages which
% enables OMS engineers to formally express mappings between OMS written
% in different languages and stored at different Web locations. The
% purpose of such OMS networks is enabling a greater extent of
% interoperability between data and services in complex application
% settings.

%
% The following features are essential to the design of this \IS:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \DOL is a language covering OMS modularity, OMS heterogeneity, and
% OMS mapping. In particular, it enables writing structured OMS
% (thereby reusing existing OMS), OMS involving different languages,
% as well as complex mappings and relations between OMS.
% \item \DOL is a declarative language with a formal semantics.
% % for modular OMS that consist of structured OMS that are possibly heterogeneous, i.e.\ are written within the same or in different OMS languages, and made available at different Web locations.
% \item \DOL provides a superset of the modularization, Web awareness and annotation facilities of a number of commonly used OMS languages, including OWL \cite{OWL2}, RDF \cite{RDF}, Common Logic \cite{ISO/IEC 24707:2007} and UML \cite{UML}.\footnote{See \cref{c:req:extensible} for details.}
% \item \DOL is an open, extensible standard that is not restricted to a fixed set of supported OMS language but specifies criteria for any existing or future OMS language to conform with \DOL.
% \item Existing OMS in languages conforming with \DOL remain as they are; they can be enriched with \DOL's modularity and annotation constructs in a non-disruptive way.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \ednote{reformulate this, see RFP}
%
%


\section{OMS Languages}
%\DOL gives interoperability a formal grounding and makes heterogeneous OMS and OMS networks and services based on them amenable to checking of coherence (e.g. consistency, conservativity, intended consequences, and compliance).
 OMS languages are declarative languages for making ontological distinctions formally precise, for modeling a domain in an unambiguous way, or for expressing algebraic specifications of software.   OMS languages are distinguished by the following features:

\begin{description}
\item[Logic] Most commonly, OMS languages are based on a description logic or some other subset of first-order logic, but in some cases, higher-order, modal, paraconsistent and other logics are used.
\item[Modularity] A means of structuring an OMS into reusable parts, reusing parts of other OMS, mapping imported symbols to those in the importing OMS, and asserting additional properties about imported symbols.
\item[Annotation] A means of enabling the attachment of human-readable descriptions to OMS symbols, addressing knowledge engineers and service developers, but also end users of OMS-based services.
\end{description}
Whereas the first feature determines the expressivity of the language and the possibilities for automated reasoning (decidability, tractability, etc.), the latter two facilitate OMS engineering as well as the engineering of OMS-based software.

Acknowledging the wide tool support that conforming established languages such as OWL, RDF, Common Logic, UML, MOF, or \CASL enjoy, existing OMS in these (and any other) conforming languages remain as they are within the \DOL framework. \DOL enhances their modularity and annotation facilities to a superset of the modularity and annotation facilities they provide themselves. 
Using \DOL's modularity constructs to make statements about modules of existing OMS works by making relevant parts of these OMS, e.g., sets of axioms, identifiable, and then referring to these identifiers from \DOL statements.  \DOL's modularity constructs are semantically well-founded within a library of formal relationships between the logics underlying the different supported OMS languages.
General annotation of OMS and their parts works in a similar way.  Here, \DOL does not provide its own annotation constructs, but once\cbs again\cbe \DOL's general mechanism of making things of interest identifiable can be employed.  Once these things have been identified, the actual annotations can be added using external mechanisms such as RDF.
\ednote{Till, is this standoff markup remark up to date? TM: we promise standoff markup at various places, but we never are specific how this can be written in \DOL.\\
CL: I have now emphasized that \DOL itself doesn't do annotation but only identification, whereas annotation is left to RDF.}

\section{\DOL in the Metamodeling Hierarchy}

\DOL uses the metamodeling hierarchy known from model-driven engineering:
$$\xymatrix{
\Text{M4} &&&
\Text{Set \& category theory}\ar@(ul,ur)^{\Text{specified in}} \restore \\
\Text{M3} &
\Text{MOF}\ar@(ul,ur)^{\Text{conforms to}} &
\Text{EBNF}\ar@(ul,ur)^{\Text{conforms to}} &
\Text{Institutions} \ar[u]^{\Text{specified in}}
\\
\Text{M2} &
\Text{\DOL metamodel} \ar[u]^{\Text{conforms to}} \ar[ur]_(0.3){\Text{conforms to}}&
\Text{OMS language metamodel}
\ar[u]_{\Text{conforms to}} \ar[ul]_(0.7){\Text{\ conforms to}} \ar[ur]_{\Text{conforms to}}
&\\
\Text{M1} & 
\Text{\DOL document} \ar[r]^{\Text{contains}} \ar[u]^{\Text{conforms to}}&
\Text{specific OMS}\ar[u]^{\Text{conforms to}}&\\
}$$

The syntax of a \DOL conformant language can be written in MOF or EBNF,
which are self-describing.  The semantics of a \DOL conformant language
is its presentation as an institution. Institutions themselves are
specified in the language of set theory and category
theory.

{In the future, it may be possible to specify the
  semantics of a \DOL conformant language using a semantics-based
  logical framework such as \cbs LF or MMT. Since LF can be specified in
  LF itself, this \cbe{} would close the loop already at
  M3 also for the semantics.}

\section{Semantic Foundations of \DOL}\label{sem-foundations}


A large variety of OMS languages in use can be captured at an abstract level using the concept of 
\emph{institutions}\index{institution} \cite{GoguenBurstall92}.
This allows the development of\cbs \DOL\cbe independently of the particularities of a logical system and to use the notions of institution and  logical language interchangeably. 
%We first introduce the concept of \emph{logic syntax}.
The main idea is to collect the non-logical
symbols of the language in signatures and to assign to each signature the set of sentences that can be formed with its symbols. 
For each signature,\cbs \DOL provides means\cbe for extracting the symbols it consists of, together with their kind.
Institutions also provide a model theory, which introduces semantics for
the language and gives a satisfaction relation between the models and
the sentences of a signature.   
% The only restriction imposed is the
% satisfaction condition, which captures the idea that truth is
% invariant under change of notation (and enlargement of context) along
% signature morphisms. This relies on two further components of
% institutions: the translation of sentences along signature morphisms,
% and the reduction of models against signature morphisms (generalizing
% the notion of model reduct known from logic).

It is also possible to complement an institution with a proof theory,
introducing a derivability relation between sentences, formalized as 
an \emph{entailment system} \cite{Meseguer89}. In particular, this
can be done for all logics that have so far been in use in \DOL.


Since institutions allow the differences between OMS languages to be elided to common abstractions, 
the semantics of basic OMS is presented in a uniform way.  The semantics of structured OMS, 
OMS mappings, OMS networks, and other \DOL expressions is defined using model-theoretic constructions
on top of institutions. 


\section{\DOL Enables Expression of Logically Heterogeneous OMS and Literal Reuse of Existing OMS}
\DOL is a mechanism for expressing logically heterogeneous OMS. It can be used to combine sentences and structured OMS expressed in different conforming OMS languages
and logics into single documents or modules. With \DOL, sentences or structured OMS of previously existing OMS in
conforming languages can be reused by literally including them into a \DOL OMS. A minimum of wrapping constructs and other annotations (e.g., for identifying the language of a sentence) are provided. 
 See the
\cbs MOF metaclass \cbe  \syntax{OMS} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

A heterogeneous OMS can import several OMS expressed in different
conforming logics, for which suitable translations have been defined
in the logic graph provided in \aref{a:graph} or in an extension to it
that has been provided when establishing the conformance of some other
logic with \DOL.  Determining the semantics of the heterogeneous OMS
requires a translation into a common target language to be applied
(\cf \cref{c:semantics}).  This translation is determined via a lookup
in the transitive closure of the logic graph.  Depending on the
reasoners available in the given application setting, it can, however,
be necessary to employ a different translation.  Authors can express
which one to employ.  \cbs However, \DOL provides default translations, which are 
applied unless the user specifies a translation that deviates from the default. Both default and non-default translations may be combined to multi-step translations.\cbe 

\section{\DOL Includes Provisions for Expressing Mappings Between OMS}\label{c:req:links}

\DOL provides a syntax for expressing mappings between OMS.  One use case illustrating both is sketched in  \fref{f:DOL-mapping}.  OMS mappings supported by \DOL include:
\begin{itemize}
\item imports (particularly including imports that lead to conservative extensions), see the
\cbs MOF metaclasses \cbe  \syntax{OMSRef} and \syntax{ExtensionOMS} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\item interpretations (both between OMS and OMS networks), see the
\cbs MOF metaclass \cbe  \syntax{InterpretationDefinition} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\item alignments between OMS, see the
\cbs MOF metaclass \cbe  \syntax{AlignmentDefinition} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\item mappings between OMS and their modules, see the
\cbs MOF metaclass \cbe  \syntax{ModuleRelDefinition} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\end{itemize}
\DOL uses symbol maps to express signature translations in such OMS mappings; see the
\cbs MOF metaclass \cbe  \syntax{SymbolMap} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

\DOL need not be able to fully represent logical translations but is
capable of referring to them.

\DOL can also be used to combine or merge OMS along such OMS mappings, see
the rule for \syntax{combination} for the \cbs MOF metaclass \cbe 
\syntax{OMS} in clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

\end{figure}



\section{\DOL Provides a Mechanism for Rich Annotation and Documentation of OMS}\label{c:req:annotation}

\DOL provides a mechanism for identifying anything of relevance in OMS by assigning an IRI to it.  With RDF there is a standard mechanism for annotating things identified by IRIs.  Thus, \DOL supports  annotations in the full generality specified in \cref{c:terms-annotation}.

%A list of recommended RDF vocabularies for annotating OMS is presented in annex \ref{a:dol-onto}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\clause{\DOL  Syntax}\label{c:abstract-syntax}%\label{a:text-syntax}

\cbs
This clause specifies the \DOL abstract syntax as a MOF metamodel.
In annex~\ref{a:EBNF}, the same abstract syntax is specified using EBNF.
We further include  the \DOL concrete syntax, which
uses the metaclasses of the abstract syntax as non-terminals of
an EBNF grammar.


At several places, the concrete syntax uses the non-terminal
\syntax{'end'} to mark the end of a definition or declaration. Tools
may make this \syntax{'end'} optional. However, in this standard,\cbs
the \syntax{'end'} is not marked as optional,\cbe because it may be needed to effectively
disambiguate heterogeneous texts.
\cbe

\medskip
The \DOL document types are as follows
		\begin{description}
			\item[MIME type] \mimetype{application/dol+text}
			\item[Filename extension] .dol
		\end{description}


\sclause{MOF Metaclasses}

\DOL provides\cbs MOF metaclasses for (among others):\cbe   
\begin{itemize}
\item OMS (which can be native OMS in some OMS language, or unions, translations, \cbs closures\cbe, combinations, approximations of OMS, among others)
\item OMS mappings 
\item OMS networks
%\item \red{queries}
\item \DOL libraries (items in these are: definitions of OMS, OMS mappings, and OMS networks, as well as qualifications choosing\cbs (i) the logic,
(2) the OMS language and/or (3) the serialization)\cbe
\item identifiers
\item annotations
\end{itemize}
 
Additionally, the \cbs MOF metaclasses \cbe of the abstract syntaxes
of any conforming OMS languages (\cf \cref{c:conform:logic}) \cbs are
subclasses of the \DOL metaclass \syntax{NativeDocument}.
If a conforming OMS language has a metaclass for basic OMS,
this is a subclass of the metaclass \syntax{BasicOMS}.\cbe






\sclause{Documents}\label{c:libraries}
\ssclause{Abstract Syntax}

\cbs
A \termref{document} (\syntax{Document}) can be a 
\begin{itemize}
\item a \DOL library, or
\item a \syntax{NativeDocument}, which is the verbatim inclusion of an
  OMS written in an OMS language that conforms with \DOL; \cf
  \ref{c:conform:logic}).
\end{itemize}
A \DOL library 
\cbe
 consists of a collection of (named)  OMS, \cbs OMS networks,\cbe{} and mappings between these.  More specifically, a \DOL
library consists of a name, followed by a list of
\syntax{LibraryItem}s.  A \syntax{LibraryItem} is either a
definition of an OMS  (\syntax{OMSDefinition}), 
a mapping between OMS
(\syntax{MappingDefinition}), 
a definition of an OMS network  (\syntax{NetworkDefinition}),
an import of another \DOL library (\syntax{LibraryImport}),
%a definition related to queries 
%(\syntax{QueryRelatedDefinition})
or a \syntax{Qualification} selecting a specific
OMS language, logic and/or syntax that is used to interpret the
subsequent \syntax{LibraryItem}s.  
\cbs A \syntax{LibraryImport} leads to the inclusion of all \syntax{LibraryItem}s of the imported \DOL library into the importing one.\cbe



At the beginning of a \DOL library, one can declare a \syntax{PrefixMap} for abbreviating long IRIs \cbs using CURIEs\cbe; see \cref{c:identifiers} for further details.

An OMS (\syntax{OMS}) can be one of the following:

language (which is defined outside this standard)\footnote{In this place, any OMS in a conforming serialization of a conforming OMS language is permitted.  
However, \DOL's module sublanguage should be given preference over the module sublanguage of

\item a translation of an OMS into a different signature or OMS
language,
\item a reduction of an OMS to a smaller signature and/or less
expressive logic (that is,
some non-logical symbols are hidden, but the semantic effect of sentences involving these is kept),
\item a module extracted from an OMS, using a restriction signature,
\item an approximation of an OMS, in a subsignature or sublogic, with the effect that sentences not expressible in the subsignature respectively sublogic are replaced with a suitable approximation,
\item a filtering of an OMS, with the effect that some signature symbols and axioms are removed from the OMS,
\item an extension of an OMS with a basic or a closable OMS, optionally named and/or marked as conservative, monomorphic, definitional, weakly definitional or implied (using a \syntax{ConservativityStrength}),
\item a union of several OMS (the major difference between a union and extension is that the members of the unions need to be self-contained OMS, while the extensions may reuse the signature of the extended OMS), 
\item a reference to an OMS existing on the Web,
\item an OMS qualified with the OMS language that is used to express it,
\item a combination of (the OMS contained in) an OMS network (technically, this is a colimit, see \cite{ZimmermanEtAl06}),
\item a \cbs closure\cbe of an OMS, forcing the subsequently declared
  non-logical symbols to be interpreted in a minimal \cbs or maximal\cbe{} way, while the non-logical symbols declared \cbs in the local environment\cbe{} are fixed (alternatively, the non-logical symbols to be \cbs minimized/maximized\cbe{} and to be varied can be explicitly declared).

maximization, freeness (minimizing also data sets and equalities on these, \cbs which enables the inductive definition of relations and datatypes), and cofreeness

\cbs
Some OMS, namely extensions and \cbs closures\cbe{}, are interpreted relative to a \emph{local environment}.
The local environment is the OMS built from all
previously-declared symbols and axioms.

A \syntax{ConservativityStrength} specifies additional relations that may hold
between an OMS and its extension, like conservative or definitional
extension. The rationale is that the extension should not have impact
on the original OMS that is being extended. A \syntax{ConservativityStrength}
might also be applied to a single OMS, which is then implicitly
regarded as an extension of the empty OMS. In this case,
satisfiability (or a similar property) of the OMS is expressed.

An OMS definition \syntax{OMSDefinition} names an  OMS.  

It can be
optionally marked as inconsistent, consistent, monomorphic or having a unique model using 
\syntax{ConservativityStrength}. More precisely, \syntax{'consequence-conservative'}
here requires the OMS to have only tautologies as signature-free logical consequences, while \syntax{'not\-consequence-conservative'} expresses that this is not the case. 
\syntax{'model-conservative'}
requires satisfiability of the OMS, \syntax{'not-model-conservative'} its
unsatisfiability.
\syntax{'de\-fi\-nitional'} expresses \cbs that the OMS has a unique model\cbe; this may be interesting for characterizing

A
\syntax{SymbolItems}, used in an OMS \syntax{Reduction}, is a
list of non-logical symbols that are to be hidden. Also,
an \syntax{OMSLanguageTranslation} denoting a logic projection
can be used a logic reduction to a
less expressive OMS language. A \syntax{SymbolMap}, used in
OMS \syntax{OMSTranslation}s,  maps symbols to symbols,

An OMS language translation \syntax{OMSLanguageTranslation}

The above grammar allows for some grouping ambiguity when using operators in
OMS definitions. These ambiguities are resolved according to the following
list, listing operators in decreasing order of precedence:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \syntax{minimize}, \syntax{maximize}, \syntax{free}, and \syntax{cofree}. 
  \item \syntax{extract}, \syntax{forget}, \syntax{hide}, \syntax{keep},
    \syntax{reject}, \syntax{remove}, \syntax{reveal}, \syntax{select}, and
    \syntax{with}.
  \item \syntax{and}.
  \item \syntax{then}.
\end{itemize}
Multiple occurrences of the same operator are grouped in a left associative
manner. In all other cases operators on the same precedence level are not
implicitly grouped and have to be grouped explicitly. Omitting such an explicit
grouping results in a parse error.

\sclause{OMS Mappings}\label{c:oms-mappings}
\ssclause{Abstract Syntax}


An OMS mapping provides a connection between two OMS. An OMS mapping definition is the definition of 
either a named interpretation (\syntax{InterpretationDefinition}, \syntax{Entailment} or 
\syntax{EquivalenceDefinition}), a named declaration of the  relation between a module of an OMS and the whole 
OMS (\syntax{ModuleRelDefinition}), or a named \termref{alignment} (\syntax{AlignmentDefinition}).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=\textheight]{mof/Class_Diagram__oms-mappings.png}
\end{center}

The \syntax{SymbolMap} in an interpretation always must lead to a signature morphism; a proof 
obligation expressing that the (translated) source OMS logically follows from the target OMS is 
generated.  An entailment is a variant where all symbols are mapped identically, while an 
equivalence states that the model classes of two OMS are in bijective correspondence.

Interpretations, entailments and equivalences between OMS networks are also possible. An 
interpretation between OMS networks has to specify both a mapping between the nodes of the OMS 
network, as well as, for each node, a symbol map from the OMS of that node to the target OMS to 
which it is mapped.
%\ednote{In equivalences between OMS networks, should we allow for node mappings 
%as well? In  \cite{MossakowskiTarlecki09}, this is allowed.
%--- No, since we do not allow for signature morphisms either.}


In contrast to this functional style of mapping symbols, an alignment provides a relational 
connection between two OMS,  using a set of \syntax{Correspondence}s. Each correspondence may relate 
some OMS non-logical symbol to another one (possibly given by a term) with an optional confidence 
value. Moreover, the relation between the two non-logical symbols can be explicitly
specified (like being equal, or only being subsumed) in a similar way to the Alignment API \cite{AlignmentAPI}. 
The relations that can be used in a correspondence are equivalence, disjointness, subsumption, membership (the last two with a
variant for each direction) or a user-defined relation that is stored in a registry and must be prefixed with
\url{http://www.omg.org/spec/DOL/correspondences/}.
A default correspondence can be used; it is applied to all pairs of non-logical symbols with 
the same local names. The default relation in a correspondence is equivalence, unless  a different 
relation is specified in a surrounding 
'CorrespondenceBlock'.
Using an \syntax{AlignmentCardinality}, left and right injectivity and totality of the
\termref{alignment} can be specified (the default is left-injective, right-injective, left-total  and right-total).
With \syntax{AlignmentSemantics}, different styles of networks of aligned ontologies (to be interpreted in 
a logic-specific way) of alignments can be specified: whether a single domain is assumed, all domains are embedded into a global domain,
or whether several local domains are linked (``contextualized'') by relations.

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mof/Class_Diagram__alignment.png}

A \syntax{ModuleRelDefinition} declares that a certain OMS
actually is a module of some other OMS with respect
to the \syntax{InterfaceSignature}.




A symbol map in an interpretation is \required to cover all non-logical symbols of the source OMS; 
the semantics specification in \cref{c:semantics} makes this assumption. ({Mapping a 
non-logical symbol twice is an error. Mapping two source non-logical symbols to the same target 
non-logical symbol is legal, this is a non-injective OMS mapping.})
