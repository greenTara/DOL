Library - A Library consists of a collection of (named) OMS, OMS networks, and mappings between these. Alternatively, a Library can be a (possibly structured) NativeOMS.
LibraryDefn - A LibraryDefn consists of a name, followed by a list of LibraryItems. The latter are (named) OMS, OMS networks, and mappings between these.
NativeOMS - The syntax of a NativeOMS is left unspecified. A NativeOMS is a verbatim inclusion of an OMS written in an OMS language that conforms with DOL. The  MOF metaclasses of the abstract syntaxes of any conforming OMS languages are
subclasses of the DOL metaclass NativeOMS.
LibraryItem - A LibraryItem is either a definition of an OMS (OMSDefn), a mapping between OMS (MappingDefn), a definition of an OMS network (NetworkDefn), an import of another library (LibImport), or a Qualification selecting a specific OMS language, logic and/or syntax that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
LibImport - Import of another library. All LibraryItems of the imported library are included into the importing one.
Qualification - A Qualification selects a specific OMS language, logic and/or syntax that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
LanguageQual - A LanguageQual selects a specific OMS language that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems. If no logic has been selected previously or the previously selected logic is not supported by the newly selected language, the language's default logic is used. An analogous rule holds for the serialization.
LogicQual - A LogicQual selects a specific logic that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
SyntaxQual - A SyntaxQual selects a specific serialization (syntax) that is used to interpret the subsequent LibraryItems.
