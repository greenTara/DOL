\sectionWN{OMG}

Founded in 1989, the Object Management Group, Inc. (OMG) is an open membership, not-for-profit computer industry standards consortium that produces and maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable, portable, and reusable enterprise applications in distributed, heterogeneous environments. Membership includes Information Technology vendors, end users, government agencies, and academia. 

OMG member companies write, adopt, and maintain its specifications following a mature, open process. OMG's specifications implement the Model Driven Architecture\textregistered\xspace (MDA\textregistered\xspace), maximizing ROI through a full-lifecycle approach to enterprise integration that covers multiple operating systems, programming languages, middleware and networking infrastructures, and software development environments. OMG's specifications include: UML\textregistered\xspace (Unified Modeling Language\texttrademark\xspace); CORBA\textregistered\xspace (Common Object Request Broker Architecture); CWM\texttrademark\xspace (Common Warehouse Metamodel); and industry-specific standards for dozens of vertical markets.

More information on the OMG is available at http://www.omg.org/.

\chapter{Scope}
\pagenumbering{arabic} 
This \IS specifies the Distributed Ontology Language (DOL) designed to achieve ontology integration and interoperability. DOL is a language for distributed knowledge representation across multiple ontologies, particularly ontologies that have been formalized in different ontology languages.

The following features are essential to the design of this \IS
\CLnote{[date=D:201110060000+02'00']Proposal for restructuring this (due to Michael Gr{\"u}ninger):
\textLF
\begin{enumerate}
\item heterogeneity
\item modularity
\begin{enumerate}
\item writing structured ontologies
\begin{enumerate}
\item reuse existing Ontologies
\item write structured ontologies
\end{enumerate}
\item writing ontologies that have multiple parts
\end{enumerate}
\item mappings (or should we say ``links'')
\item annotation
\end{enumerate}
}:

\begin{itemize}
\item DOL is a declarative language with a formal semantics for modular ontologies that consist of structured ontologies that are possibly heterogeneous, i.e.\ are written within the same or in different ontology languages, and made available at different Web locations.
\item DOL provides a superset of the modularization and annotation facilities of a number of commonly used ontology languages, including OWL \nitem{W3C/TR REC-owl2-syntax:2009} and Common Logic \nitem{ISO/IEC 24707:2007}\footnote{See \cref{c:req:extensible} for details.}.
\item DOL is an open, extensible standard that is not restricted to a fixed set of supported ontology language but specifies criteria for any existing or future ontology language to conform with DOL.
\item Existing ontologies in languages conforming with DOL remain as they are; they can be enriched with DOL's modularity and annotation constructs in a non-disruptive way.
\end{itemize}

% Can't use \begin{inscope}, as that creates an itemize environment
The following are within the scope of this \IS:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{it:scope-heterogeneous} heterogeneous ontologies that combine parts written in different languages
\item links between distributed and heterogeneous (possibly structured) ontologies
\item\label{it:scope-annotation} annotation and documentation of ontologies, links between ontologies, symbols,
and sentences
\item \label{it:scope-translation} translations between different ontology languages
\item recommendations of vocabularies for annotating and documenting ontologies
\item a syntax for embedding the constructs mentioned under (\ref{it:scope-heterogeneous})–(\ref{it:scope-annotation}) as annotations into existing ontologies
\item a syntax for expressing (\ref{it:scope-heterogeneous})–(\ref{it:scope-translation}) as standoff markup that points into existing ontologies
\item a formal semantics of (\ref{it:scope-heterogeneous})–(\ref{it:scope-translation})
\item criteria for existing or future ontology languages to conform with DOL
\end{enumerate}


The following are outside the scope of this \IS:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the (re)definition of elementary ontology languages, \ie languages that allow for declaring ontology non-logical symbols 
\CLnote[type=todo]{We somehow need to rephrase this (here and elsewhere); it reads quite ugly.  Maybe just say ``non-logical symbols''?  Or, if absolutely necessary, reorder the words into ``non-logical ontology symbols''.} 
and
stating sentences about them
\item algorithms for obtaining links between ontologies
\item concrete ontologies and their conceptualization and application
%% I believe that this is really obsolete now. –Christoph Lange, 2011-12-13
% \item a formal definition of interoperability and how to measure the degree of interoperability of two systems\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110182133+02'00']{Well, now this might even be in scope.  We'll see...}
\item mappings between services and devices, and definitions of service and device interoperability.
\end{enumerate}

This \IS describes the syntax and the semantics of the Distributed Ontology Language (DOL) by defining an abstract syntax and an associated model-theoretic semantics for DOL. DOL does not provide a new elementary ontology language, but provides a layer to be used on top of existing elementary ontology languages which enables ontology engineers to formally express links between ontologies written in different languages and stored at different Web locations. The purpose of such distributed ontologies is enabling a greater extent of interoperability between data and services in complex application settings.

\chapter{Conformance}

This clause defines conformance criteria for languages and logics that
can be used with the distributed ontology language DOL, as well as
conformance criteria for serializations, translations and
applications. This International Standard describes the conformance
with DOL of a number of ontology languages, namely OWL 2, Common
Logic, RDF and RDFS, as well as translations among these, in its
normative annexes.

It is expected that DOL will be used for more languages than this
normative set of DOL-conformant\CLnote[type=fyi]{coherently rephrased from ``compliant'' to ``conformant''} languages. There will be a
\textbf{registry for DOL-conformant languages and translations} hosted
at \url{http://ontohub.org}.  This will ensure that this International
Standard remains interoperable with past, present and future ontology
languages, even if they do not appear in this standard or do not even have
been standardized (yet).  The
registry shall also include descriptions of DOL-conformant languages
and translations (as well as other information needed by implementors
and users) in machine-processable form.  

There will be Maintenance Authority (MA)\ednote{ or, depending on
  advisability, a Registration Authority} established to maintain the
registry as an informative resource governed by the standard.  The
registry contents itself will not be normative; however, it is
expected to become the basis for normative activities.


\sclause{Conformance of an ontology language/a logic with DOL}\label{c:conform:logic}


%
%\begin{description}
%\item[Entailment conformance] An ontology language is entailment conformant with DOL if
%its logic is presented as a (not necessarily monotonic) entailment system.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=todo]{if we want belief revision, we need to talk about "lists of sentences" (i.e. something ordered)}\footnote{Text that goes into ``terms and definitions'': an entailment system consists of a set of sentences $\Sen(\Sigma)$ and a relation $\operatorname{\vdash}\subseteq \mathcal{P}(\Sen(\Sigma))\times \Sen(\Sigma)$, indexed by signatures $\Sigma$ and compatible with signature morphisms.}
%
%\item[Semantic conformance] 
%\end{description}

An ontology language is conformant with DOL if either
\begin{itemize}
\item it satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item its abstract syntax is given by an EBNF grammar,
\item at least one concrete syntax is given by a serialisation (see below), 
\item its logical language aspect (for expressing basic ontologies) is conformant, and in particular has a semantics (see below),
\item  its
structuring language aspect (for expressing structured ontologies and relations
between those) is conformant (see below), and
\item its annotation language aspect (for expressing comments and annotations)
is conformant (see below).
\end{enumerate}
\item there exists a translation of it into a conformant language.
\end{itemize}

For the second condition, \cf the
translation of OBO1.4 to OWL, giving a formal semantics to OBO1.4).
\todonote{turn this into a note}

The \emph{logical language aspect} of an ontology language
is %semantically
conformant with DOL if each logic corresponding to a profile (including
the logic corresponding to the whole logical language aspect) is presented as an
institute. It may additionally be presented as an institution, leading
to the possibility of interpreting additional DOL language constructs.
\footnote{Institutes and institutions are necessarily monotonic;
  conformance criteria for non-monotonic logics are still under
  development. However, minimization provides non-monotonic reasoning
  in DOL.}
Note that one ontology language can have several sublanguages or profiles 
corresponding to several logics (for example, OWL 2 has profiles
EL, RL and QL, apart from the whole OWL 2 itself).


The \emph{structuring language aspect}  of an ontology language
is conformant with DOL if it can be mapped to DOL's structuring language
in a semantics-preserving way. The structuring language aspect \may be empty.

The \emph{annotation language aspect} of an ontology language is
conformant with DOL if its constructs have no impact on the semantics.
The annotation language aspect \shall may be non-empty; it \shall
provide the facility to express comments.

~\CLnote{say something about ``infrastructure theories'', i.e. axiomatizations of one logic in another logic.  Providers of ontology language translations MAY also provide these (given that the translation is theoroidal).  Note the possible trade-off between readability and theorem proving complexity (as the infrastructure axioms may be complex) -- so maybe we should encourage multiple alternative translations to co-exist.}

We define the following levels of conformance of the abstract syntax of a basic ontology language with DOL, listed from highest to lowest:

\begin{description}
\item[Full IRI conformance] The abstract syntax enforces that IRIs be used for identifying all symbols and entities.
\item[No mandatory use of IRIs] The abstract syntax does not enforce that IRIs be used for identifying all entities.  Note that this includes the case of optionally supporting IRIs without enforcing their use (such as in Common Logic).
\end{description}

Any conforming language and logic shall have a machine-processable description as detailed in \cref{c:conform:description}.

\ssclause{Conformance of language/logic translations with DOL}

A logic translation is conformant with DOL if it is presented
either as an institute morphism or as an institute comorphism.  If the
languages are presented additionally as institutions, the translations
\may also be presented as an institution morphism or an institution
comorphism.

A language translation is conformant with DOL if it is a mapping
between the abstract syntaxes that restricts to a conformant logic
translation when restricted to the logical language aspect. Language
translations \may also translate the structuring language aspect, in
this case, they \shall preserve the semantics of the structuring
language aspect.  Furthermore, language translations \should preserve
comments and annotations.  All comments attached to a sentence (or
symbol) in the source \should be attached to its translation in the
target (if there are more than one sentences (resp.\ symbols)
expressing the translation, to at least one of them).


\sclause{Conformance of a serialization of an ontology language with DOL}\label{c:conform:serialization}

We define four levels of conformance of a serialization of an ontology language with DOL.

These are the conformance levels, listed from highest to lowest:
\begin{description}
\item[XML conformance]
The given serialization has to be specified as an XML schema, which satisfies all of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The elements of the schema belong to one or more non-empty XML namespaces.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110051438+02'00',type=fyi]{That means that in a heterogeneous ontology we can recognize that a sentence is, \eg, stated in OWL, without explicitly ``tagging'' it as ``OWL'' (which we would have to do in the case of a serialization that is merely text conformant).}
\item The schema shall not forbid attributes from foreign namespaces (here: the DOL namespace) on any elements\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110051433+02'00']{Maybe we also need child elements from different namespaces?}
\end{itemize}

\item[RDF conformance]
The given serialization has to be specified as an RDF vocabulary, which satisfies all of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The elements of the vocabulary belong to one or more RDF namespaces identified by absolute URIs.
\item The serialization shall specify ways of giving IRIs or URIs to all structural elements of an ontology.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201109221422+02'00',type=q-aut]{And what if it doesn't? \eg OWL doesn't specify IRIs for import declarations, so we can, \eg, not annotate them when using the RDF serialization of OWL. We could only do it via RDF reification, or by using an XML serialization.}
\item There shall be no additional rules that forbid properties from foreign namespaces (here in particular: the annotation vocabularies recommended by DOL) to be stated about arbitrary subjects\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201109221416+02'00',type=fyi]{No well-behaved RDF vocabulary would do so, but we'd better be safe.}
\end{itemize}

\item[Text conformance]
The given serialization has to satisfy all of the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The serialization conforms with the requirements for the \mimetype{text/plain} media type specified in \nisref{IETF/RFC 2046}, section 4.1.3.
\item The serialization shall provide a designated comment construct that can be placed sufficiently flexible as to be uniquely associated with any non-comment construct of the language.  That means, for example, one of the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The serialization provides a construct that indicates the start and end of a comment and may be placed before/after each token that represents a structural element of an ontology.
  \item The serialization provides line-based comments (ranging from an indicated position to the end of a line) but at the same time allows for flexibly placing line breaks before/after each token that represents a structural element of an ontology.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item[Standoff markup conformance]
An ontology language is standoff markup conformant with DOL if one of its serializations conforms with the requirements for the \mimetype{text/plain} media type specified in \nisref{IETF/RFC 2046}, section 4.1.3.  Note that conformance with \mimetype{text/plain} is a prerequisite for using, for example, fragment URIs in the style of \nisref{IETF/RFC 5147} for identifying text ranges.
\end{description}

~\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=fyi]{The latter two seem trivial, but we need them to rule out ad hoc diagrams drawn on a napkin}

Independently from the conformance levels given above, there is the following hierarchy of conformance \wrt CURIEs as a means of abbreviating IRIs, listed from highest to lowest:
\begin{description}
\item[Prefixed CURIE conformance] The given serialization allows that non-logical symbol identifiers have the syntactic form of a CURIE, or any subset of the CURIE grammar that allows named prefixes (\syntax{prefix:reference}).  The serialization is \notrequired to support CURIEs with no prefix.\\
  Informative comment: In this case, a prefix map with multiple prefixes \may be used to map the non-logical symbol identifiers of a basic ontology to IRIs in multiple namespaces (\cf \cref{c:map-ids})
\item[Unprefixed names only] The given serialization only supports CURIEs with no prefix, or any subset of the grammar of the \syntax{REFERENCE} nonterminal in the CURIE grammar.\\
  Informative comment: In this case, a binding for the empty prefix \hasto be declared, as this is the only possibility of mapping the identifiers of the basic ontology to IRIs, which are located in one flat namespace.
\end{description}

\CLnote[type=todo]{add the possibility to provide an alternative CURIE separate character in the conformance declaration, as mentioned in \cref{c:map-ids}}

Any conforming serialization of an ontology language shall have a machine-processable description as detailed in \cref{c:conform:description}.

\sclause{Machine-processable description of conforming languages, logics, and serializations}\label{c:conform:description}

For any conforming ontology language, logic, and serialization of an ontology language, it is required that it be assigned an HTTP IRI, by which it can be identified.  It is also required that a machine-processable description of this language/logic/serialization be retrievable by dereferencing this IRI, according to the linked data principles.  At least there has to be an RDF description in terms of the vocabulary specified in \aref{a:rdf-logic-vocab}, which has to be made available in the RDF/XML serialization when a client requests content of the MIME type \mimetype{application/rdf+xml}.  Descriptions of the language/logic/serialization in further representations, having different content types, may be provided.\CLnote[type=fyi]{that opens the door for, \eg, OMDoc}

\sclause{Conformance of a serialization with DOL}\label{c:conform:dialect}

While \cref{c:conform:serialization} covered the conformance of serializations of \emph{basic} ontology languages with DOL, this clause addresses serializations of DOL itself.  This international standard specifies one text-based serialization in \aref{a:text-syntax}, but one can specify further serializations according to the following conformance criteria.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201111041524+01'00',type=fyi]{This section is analogous to Common Logic's ``Dialect Conformance''.}

It is required that a specification of a conforming serialization be given as a set of mappings from the abstract syntax (\cf \cref{c:abstract-syntax}), where each production rule of the abstract syntax is mapped to a production rule of the concrete syntax.  Instead of such an explicit mapping, an implicit mapping may be provided via a self-contained EBNF for the concrete syntax, whose nonterminal symbols have to match the nonterminal symbols of the EBNF of the abstract syntax.\todonote[type=todo,author=Christoph Lange]{Say that in a more formal way! -- Is it comprehensible?  Does it sufficiently state what we have in mind?}

\sclause{Conformance of a document with DOL}\label{c:conform:document}

A document conforms with DOL if it contains a well-formed DOL ontology.  That means, in particular, that any information related to logics has to be made explicit (as foreseen by the DOL abstract syntax specified in \cref{c:abstract-syntax}), such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item the logic of each ontology that is part of the distributed ontology
\item the translation that is employed between two logics (unless it is one of the default translations specified in \aref{a:graph})
\end{itemize}
However, details about aspects of an ontology that do not have a formal, logic-based semantics, may be left implicit.  For example, a conforming document may omit explicit references to matching algorithms that have been employed in obtaining an alignment.

\sclause{Conformance of an application with DOL}\label{c:conform:application}

In practice, DOL-aware \emph{applications} are also allowed to deal with documents that are not conforming with DOL according to the criteria established in \cref{c:conform:document}.  However, an application only \emph{conforms} with DOL if it is capable of producing DOL-conforming documents as its output when requested.

We expect most DOL-aware applications to support a fixed (possibly extensible) set of ontology languages conforming with DOL.  It is, for example, possible that a DOL-aware application only supports OWL and Common Logic.  In that case, the application is allowed to process documents that mix OWL and Common Logic ontologies \emph{without} explicitly declaring the respective logics, as the respective syntaxes of OWL and Common Logic allow for telling such ontologies apart by looking at the keywords used.  However, for DOL conformance, that application has to be capable of exporting documents with explicit references to the logics used.

~\CLnote{applications need to strip DOL annotations from embedded fragments in other ontology languages}

~\CLnote{applications need to be able to expand CURIEs into IRIs when requested}

\chapter{Terms and Definitions}

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

\sclause{Ontologies}

\begin{definitions}

  \termdefinition{ontology}{set of expressions (like \termref{non-logical symbols}, \termref{sentences} and \termref{structuring} elements) in a  given \termref{ontology language}}%
\begin{note}
	An \termref{ontology} can be written in different \termref{ontology language} \termref{serializations}.
\end{note}	

  \termdefinition{ontology language}{language that is used for the formal specification of \termref{ontologies}, equipped with a formal, declarative, logic-based semantics, plus non-logical \termref{annotations}}
  \begin{example}
    Ontology languages include OWL, Common Logic, F-logic, UML class diagrams, RDFS, and OBO.
  \end{example}
  
  \termdefinition{non-logical symbol}{atomic expression or syntactic constituent of an \termref{ontology} that requires an interpretation through a \termref{model}}
  \begin{example}
    Non-logical symbols in OWL \nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-syntax:2009} (there called ``entities'') comprise
    \begin{itemize}
    \item individuals (denoting objects from the domain of discourse),
    \item classes (denoting sets of objects; also called concepts), and
    \item properties (denoting binary relations over objects; also called
      roles).
    \end{itemize}
    This is opposed to logical symbols in OWL, e.g.\ those for intersection
    and union of classes.
  \end{example}
  \begin{example}
    Non-logical symbols in Common Logic \nisref{ISO/IEC 24707:2007} comprise
    \begin{itemize}
    \item names (denoting objects from the domain of discourse),
    \item sequence markers (denoting sequences of objects).
    \end{itemize}
    This is opposed to logical symbols in Common Logic, e.g.\ logical connectives and
    quantifiers.
  \end{example}
  
  \termdefinition{signature}{set of all \termref{non-logical symbols} of an \termref{ontology}}
  
  \termdefinition{model}{semantic interpretation of all \termref{non-logical symbols} of a \termref{signature}}
  \begin{note}
    A model of an ontology is a model of the signature of the ontology
    that moreover \termref{satisfies} all the \termref{axioms} of the ontology.
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
  This term is not to be confused with model in the sense of modeling.
  \end{note}
  
  \termdefinition{term}{syntactic expression either consisting of a single \termref{non-logical symbol} or recursively composed of other terms (a.k.a. its subterms)}
  
  \termdefinition{sentence}{term that is either true or false in a given \termref{model}, i.e.\ which is assigned a truth value in this \termref{model}.\CLnote[type=fyi]{From Common Logic, I changed ``unit of logical text'' to ``term''.}}
  \begin{note}
    In a \termref{model}, on the one hand, a sentence is always true or false. In an \termref{ontology}, on the other hand, a sentence can have several logical statuses: it can be an axiom, if postulated to be true; a theorem, if proven from other axioms and theorems; a conjecture, if expecting to be proven from other axioms and theorems; or have another of many possible statuses.
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
  A sentence can conform to one or more signatures (namely those signatures
  containing all non-logical symbols used in the sentence).
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
  It is quite common that sentences are required to be closed (i.e.\ have no
  free variables). However, this depends on the ontology language at hand.
  \end{note}


  \termdefinition{axiom}{\termref{sentence} postulated to be valid (i.e.\ true in every \termref{model})}

  \termdefinition{theorem}{\termref{sentence} that has been proven from other \termref{axiom}s and \termref{theorem}s}

  \termdefinition{satisfaction relation}{relation between models and sentences indicating which sentences hold true in the model}

\end{definitions}  

\sclause{Semantic Web}\label{c:terms-semantic-web}

\begin{definitions}
  \termdefinition{resource\subjectfield{web}}{something that can be globally identified}
  \begin{note}
    \nisref{IETF/RFC 3986:2005, Section 1.1} deliberately defines a resource as ``in a general sense \textelp{} whatever might be identified by \textins*{an IRI}''.  The original source refers to URIs, but DOL uses the compatible IRI standard \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987:2005} for identification.
  \end{note}
  \begin{example}
    Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a source of information with a consistent purpose (\eg, ``today's weather report for Los Angeles''), a service (\eg, an HTTP-to-SMS gateway), and a collection of other resources. A resource is not necessarily accessible via the Internet; \eg, human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be resources. Likewise, abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship (\eg, ``parent'' or ``employee''), or numeric values (\eg, zero, one, and infinity). \nisref{IETF/RFC 3986:2005, Section 1.1}
  \end{example}
  \termdefinition{element\subjectfield{ontology}\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201111151622+01'00',type=fyi]{This term is adopted from OWL 2, where it is used, but in a non-normative context.}}{any \termref{resource} in an \termref{ontology} (\eg a \termref{non-logical symbol}, a \termref{sentence}, a \termref{correspondence}, the \termref{ontology} itself, ...) or a named set of such \termref{resources}}
  
  \termdefinition{linked data}{structured data that is published on the Web in a machine-processable way, according to principles specified in \bref{BernersLee:LinkedData2006}}
  \begin{note}
    The linked data principles (adapted from \bref{BernersLee:LinkedData2006} and its paraphrase at \bref{Wikipedia:LinkedData2011}) are the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use IRIs as names for things.
    \item Use HTTP IRIs so that these things can be referred to and looked up (``dereferenced'') by people and user agents.\footnote{I.e., the IRI is treated as a URL (uniform resource locator).}
    \item Provide useful machine-processable (plus optionally human-readable) information about the thing when its IRI is dereferenced, using standard formats.
    \item Include links to other, related IRIs in the exposed data to improve discovery of other related information on the Web.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{note}

  \begin{note}
    RDF, serialized as RDF/XML \bref{W3C:REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20040210}, is the most common format for publishing linked data.  However, its usage is not mandatory.
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
    Using HTTP content negotiation \bref{rfc2616} it is possible to serve representations in different formats from the same URL.
  \end{note}
\end{definitions}

\sclause{Ontology Annotation and Documentation}\label{c:terms-annotation}
 
\begin{definitions}
  \termdefinition{annotation}{additional information without a logical semantics that is attached to an \termref{element} of an \termref{ontology}}
  \begin{note}\label{note:annotation-rdf}
    Formally, an annotation is given as a $(\text{subject}, \text{predicate}, \text{object})$ triple as defined by \nisref{SOURCE: W3C/TR REC-rdf-concepts:2004, Section 6}.  The subject of an annotation is an \termref{element} of an ontology.  The predicate is an RDF property defined in an external ontology and describes in what way the annotation object is related to the annotation subject.
  \end{note}
  \begin{note}
    According to note~\ref{note:annotation-rdf} it is possible to interpret annotations under an RDF semantics.  ``Without a logical semantics'' in this definition means that annotations to an ontology are not considered sentences of the ontology.
  \end{note}

  % \termdefinition{datatype}{``consists of a lexical space, a value space and a lexical-to-value mapping \textins{and} is identified by one or more URI
  %   references'' \nisref{SOURCE: W3C/TR REC-rdf-concepts:2004, Section 5}}
  % \begin{note}

\chapter{Additional Information}
An ontology is a formal description of the concepts and relationships
that are of interest to an agent or a community of agents. Today,
ontologies are applied in eBusiness, eHealth, eGovernment, eInclusion,
eLearning, smart environments, ambient assisted living (AAL), and
virtually all other information-rich endeavours. Ontologies have been
used initially and principally for data and database integration
through providing a common representation of the subject domain onto
which the data sources can be mapped meaningfully. Over the years, the
purpose has broadened beyond data and services interoperability to
include a wide range of tasks and ontologies are used in information
systems at run-time, such as being a component in \emph{in silico}
scientific workflows, used for natural language processing, in
ontology-driven querying of digital libraries, user profiling in
recommender systems, adaptive e-Learning tools, and
more.\todonote[author=Terry
Longstreth,date=D:201110060000+02'00']{Terry Longstreth:
  Interoperability in this context seems to be mutual consistency?
  Fostering Mutual Consistency among disjoint ontological formalisms
  (intensions) and their realisations (extensions). TM: yes, but more
  than that: also interfacability, such that the joint use in a common
  application scenario is enabled.}

  In complex applications, which involve multiple ontologies with overlapping concept spaces, data mapping is also required on a higher level of abstraction, viz.\ between different ontologies, and is then called ontology alignment.  While ontology alignment is most commonly studied for ontologies formalized\CLnote{spell-check everything for British} in the same ontology language, the different ontologies used by complex applications may also be written in different ontology languages. This international standard faces this diversity not by proposing yet another ontology language that would subsume all the others.  Instead, it accepts the diverse reality and formulates means (on a sound and formal semantic basis) to compare and integrate ontologies that are written in different formalisms. It specifies DOL (Distributed Ontology Language), a formal language for expressing not only ontologies but also links between ontologies formalized in different ontology languages.

Thus, it gives interoperability a formal grounding and makes heterogeneous ontologies and services based on them amenable to checking of coherence (\eg consistency, conservativity, intended consequences, and compliance).

Ontology languages are declarative languages for making ontological distinctions formally precise. They are distinguished by the following features:

\begin{description}
\item[Logic] Most commonly, ontology languages are based on a description logic or some other subset of first order logic, but in some cases, also higher-order, modal, paraconsistent and other logics are used.
\item[Modularity] means of structuring an ontology into reusable parts, reusing parts of other ontologies, mapping imported symbols to those in the importing ontology, and asserting additional properties about imported symbols.
\item[Annotation] means of attaching human-readable descriptions to ontology symbols, addressing knowledge engineers and service developers, but also end users of ontology-based services.\ednote{TODO Christoph: reformulate. DOL enables the use of annotations}
\end{description}
Whereas the first feature determines the expressivity of the language and the possibilities for automated reasoning (decidability, tractability, etc.), the latter two intend to facilitate ontology engineering as well as the engineering of ontology-based software.

Within the DOL framework, existing ontologies in conforming established languages such as OWL or Common Logic remain as they are, acknowledging the wide tool support these languages enjoy.  DOL enhances their modularity and annotation facilities to a superset of the modularity and annotation facilities they provide themselves. DOL's modularity and annotation constructs can either be embedded into existing ontologies as non-disruptive annotations, or they can be provided as standoff markup, pointing to the ontologies they talk about; DOL specifies a syntax and semantics for both variants. DOL's modularity constructs are semantically well-founded within a library of formal relationships between the logics underlying the different supported ontology languages.

\section{DOL requirements}\label{c:req:overview}

DOL has been designed and developed with several requirements in mind, all arising from its intended role of enabling ontology interoperability. The use of ``{\should}'' in the rest of clause 5 indicates a desired goal but is not required of DOL (in accordance with Annex H of ISO/IEC Directives -- Part 2).

\CLnote[type=todo]{give quick overview here.  Create clause 5.2 for requirements, and 5.3 for design overview. TM: done}

DOL \should be
\begin{description}

\subsection{DOL is a logic-agnostic metalanguage, in the sense that its constructs can be used for many different logics.}\label{c:req:agnostic}

\CLnote{here and elsewhere: remove ``shall'' from section headers}

DOL \shall provide syntactic constructs for structuring ontologies regardless of the logic their sentences are formalized in. DOL \should provide syntactic constructs for

\begin{itemize}
\item basic and structured ontologies (and facilities to identify them in a globally unique way),
\item explicit extraction of modules from existing ontologies, \markupcomment[author=Christoph Lange,type=q-aut]{such that, \eg, changes in the ontology can be propagated to the extracted module}{This rather sounds like a use case description to me than like a requirement.  Move it somewhere else?  Where?}.
\item links between ontologies (\cf \cref{c:req:links}), including interpretations, relations between ontologies and their modules, as well as alignments.
\end{itemize}
DOL \shallnot provide its own constructs for expressing sentences.  Instead, it \shall \textit{inherit} the logical language aspects of conforming ontology languages.  It \should be possible to literally include sentences expressed in such ontology languages in a DOL ontology.

DOL \shall provide an initial set of built-in approximation methods and module extraction selectors.  Additionally, it \shall provide a means of referring to approximation methods and module extraction selectors defined externally of this international standard.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201111030047+01'00',type=fyi]{In practice we will use IRIs for that purpose.}

DOL \shall provide an initial vocabulary for expressing relations in correspondences (as part of alignments between ontologies).  Additionally, it \shall provide a means of reusing relation types defined externally of this international standard.

DOL \shallnot provide an annotation vocabulary, i.e.\ it \shall neither provide annotation properties nor datatypes to be used with literal annotation objects. Instead, an informative annex \shall recommend existing annotation vocabularies for use with DOL.

\subsection{DOL has user- and machine-readable serializations.}

\CLnote[type=q-all]{We need to revise this following the agreement to drop the XML and RDF serializations.}In the interest of wide applicability and tool support, DOL \should support multiple alternative serializations.  In particular, there \should be a text serialization targeting human readers and writers, as well as serializations optimized for machine processability.

This international standard \shall specify criteria for a serialization to conform with DOL, and it \shall specify the following conforming serializations:

\begin{itemize}
\item a human-readable \textbf{text serialization}
\item a machine-processable \textbf{interchange format}, to be implemented as
  \begin{description}
  \item[an XML schema (DOL XML)] particularly targeting document or form based authoring, validation, as well as translation from and to serializations of existing ontology languages\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201204050853+02'00',type=q-all]{I think it's reasonable to call this ``DOL XML'' instead of ``DIF XML'', as to emphasize the ``brand'' DOL}, and
  \item[an RDF vocabulary (DOL RDF)] particularly targeting interlinking and annotation.
  \end{description}
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{text serialization} in particular \shall offer a syntax for abbreviating identifiers of resources within ontologies in a way that does not require authors to write down their full global identifiers.

An ontology implemented in DOL \should be able to comprise parts formalized in any ontology language; any serialization of DOL \should be able to literally include such parts, regardless of the ontology language serialization they have been written in. \todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201109200256+02'00',type=fyi]{advanced namespacing is the solution that addresses this requirement} Additionally, an ontology implemented in DOL \should be able to refer to any external ontologies formalized in any ontology language, as long as they can be identified in a globally unique way.

Existing ontologies in existing XML serializations (\eg XCL) or text serializations (\eg OWL Manchester Syntax) \should validate as DOL ontologies with a minimum amount of syntactic adaptation. Existing ontology files/documents \should be usable in a DOL context without the need for modification.

\subsection{DOL has a well-defined formal, logic-based semantics.}\label{c:req:semantics}

The structural elements and structural links of DOL \should have a formal, logic-based semantics.

This international standard specifies ontology language translations between conforming languages:\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=fyi]{we shall establish the conformance of an initial set of languages with DOL. As a part of that work we deliver the "onto-logical translation graph" between these languages. Anyone, who wants to establish the conformance of another language with DOL, has to add a node to the graph, and at least one edge from/to an existing node.}

\begin{itemize}
\item ontology language translations between their logical language aspects. For any such ontology language translation its properties \should be determined, \eg whether it is a sublogic, a theoroidal translation, etc. \\

\item ontology language translations between their structuring language aspects and the structuring language aspect of DOL.
\end{itemize}

There might be multiple different possible translations between two languages, \eg two ways of expressing OWL roles in CL (binary predicate vs.\ boolean function).  But in order to free the user from always writing down such IRIs, we shall specify some defaults in our translation graph.}, see the abstract syntax category
\syntax{Translation} in clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.  DOL need not be capable of expressing ontology language translations.

\label{f:DOL-translations}
\end{figure}

For each pair $L_1$ and $L_2$ of ontology languages, ontology language translations $T_1$ and $T_2$ into a common target ontology language $L_T$ \should be specified. (If $L_T$ does not exist, the only way to express a heterogeneous ontology involving $L_1$ and $L_2$ may be to keep the DOL expression and the individual ontologies in $L_1$ and $L_2$.)  These \should be translations into an ontology language that is more expressive than both $L_1$ and $L_2$, such that the union of the images of the translations is a subset of the target ontology language ($T_1(L_1)\cup T_2(L_2)\subseteq L_T$).  \fref{f:DOL-translations} outlines such an example, where Common Logic serves as the common target for OWL and RDFS, as it is more expressive than either of them.\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=fyi]{In the context of that, specify when a document/an ontology conforms with DOL.}  If such a target ontology language or suitable translations do not yet exist, translations into a less expressive language may be specified as an alternative, such that the intersection of the images of the translations forms a subset of the target language ($T_1(L_1)\cap T_2(L_2)\subseteq L_T$), which \should be as large as possible.  For example, an ontology language that is more expressive than both Common Logic and F-Logic does not yet exist; therefore, it would be possible to specify translations into the first-order logic subset of either ontology language.



Reductions of DOL to conforming ontology languages, as well as approximations of DOL in conforming ontology languages, are specified.  This is to ensure that ontologies that have originally been written in DOL can be reused and extended in the respective target ontology languages. While approximations are desirable that preserve as much information from the DOL ontology as the logic underlying the target ontology language is capable of expressing (possibly after a suitable ontology language translation), there \should at least be a trivial reduction that throws away all syntactic constructs of the DOL ontology that are not syntactic constructs in the target ontology language. However, those constructs are optionally preserved as annotations in the output (cf. \cref{c:req:annotation} for annotations).

\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=todo]{provide example of integrating two ontologies in a single-sorted logic by translating into many-sorted logic, where only many-sorted logic would guarantee consistency}

\section{DOL design}\label{c:design:overview}

We give an overview of the most important and innovative language
constructs of DOL. Details can be found in clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

\subsection{DOL allows for expressing logically heterogeneous ontologies and literal reuse of existing ontologies.}

DOL allows for expressing logically heterogeneous ontologies, \ie to
combine, in the same DOL document, sentences and structured ontologies
expressed in different conforming ontology languages and logics.  It
is possible to reuse sentences or structured ontologies of previously
existing ontologies in conforming languages by literally including
them into a DOL ontology.  A minimum of wrapping constructs and other
annotations (\eg for disambiguating in what language a sentence has
been expressed) are provided.\todonote[author=Christoph
Lange,date=D:201109201457+02'00',type=todo]{Figure out what this
  feedback item from Michael Grüninger (?) means: say that there
  should be a syntax for relationships btw. ontologies as well as a
  syntax for heterogeneous ontologies. (If you write down an ontology,
  it might involve constructs that only exist in OWL)} See the
abstract syntax category \syntax{Onto} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

\subsection{DOL allows for expressing links between ontologies.}\label{c:req:links}

DOL provides a syntax for expressing links between ontologies -- logical links as well as alignments.  One use case illustrating both is sketched in  \fref{f:DOL-mapping}. This international standard specifies a set of logical link types and a set of non-logical link types.

Logical links supported by DOL include:
\begin{itemize}
\item imports (particularly including imports that lead to conservative extensions), see the
abstract syntax categories \syntax{OntoRef} and \syntax{ExtensionOnto} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\item interpretations, see the
abstract syntax category \syntax{IntprDefn} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\item links between ontologies and their modules, see the
abstract syntax category \syntax{ModuleRelDefn} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.
\end{itemize}
DOL allows for expressing signature translations in such links, see the
abstract syntax category \syntax{SymbolMapItems} in
clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

DOL need not be able to fully represent logical translations but is
capable of referring to them.

\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201111231324+01'00',type=q-aut]{We had this comment here; what does it mean?  ``DOL only maps symbols to expressions''}

DOL also allows for combining/merging ontologies along such links, see
the rule for \syntax{combination} for the abstract syntax category
\syntax{Onto} in clause~\ref{c:abstract-syntax}.

  \caption{Linking two ontologies formulated in different ontology languages}
\label{f:DOL-mapping}
\end{figure}

\subsection{DOL allows for expressing ontologies and links at different levels of detail}\label{c:explicit}

Ontologies and ontology links expressed in DOL can be based on a
number of implicit assumptions about which ontology language
translation or which ontoloy matcher has been employed.  Depending on
the ontology engineering workflow or application setting, it can be
useful to keep these assumptions implicit, or to make them explicit.
DOL allows for keeping such assumptions implicit if desired.
It also allows for explicitly writing them down as annotations
to the ontology.  This international standard specifies a
translation that expands any DOL ontology with implicit assumptions
into its explicit counterpart.

The following list covers the possible cases where DOL allows for making information implicit or explicit:
\begin{description}
\item[default ontology language translations] A heterogeneous ontology can import several (structured) ontologies expressed in different conforming logics, for which suitable translations have been defined in the logic graph provided in \aref{a:graph} or in an extension to it that has been provided when establishing the conformance of some other logic with DOL.  Determining the semantics of the heterogeneous ontology requires a translation into a common target language to be applied (\cf \cref{c:req:semantics}).  This translation is determined via a lookup in the transitive closure of the logic graph.  Depending on the reasoners available in the given application setting, it can, however, be necessary to employ a different translation.  Authors can express which one to employ.  In a multi-step translation, it is possible to implicitly apply as many default translations as possible, and to concentrate on making explicit only those translations that deviate from the default.\CLnote[type=q-aut]{Will this situation be the same for default approximations, or to we need to add an extra item to the list?}
\item[different matching algorithms] Ontology alignments, which DOL is able to express, may have been obtained by running different ontology matching algorithms.  If, in a given ontology engineering workflow, the information on which algorithm has been applied is clear from the context, it is possible to omit it in the alignment expressed in DOL.  Otherwise, \eg if the next person working on the ontology requires that information, it is possible to make it explicit.\todonote{TM: the alignment itself should be there explicitly. right? But then the information about the matching algorithm that has produced it is a mere annotation without semantics, isn't it?\\ CL: I agree with you. OK, so we will replace this with approximation algorithms.}
\end{description}

~\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201110060000+02'00',type=todo]{ask Michael Grüninger for his mereology example in CL}

\subsection{DOL allows for rich annotation and documentation of ontologies.}\label{c:req:annotation}

\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201211141640+00'00',type=q-all]{I think that now that we have agreed on dumping the RDF and XML serializations of DOL, this requirement can no longer be satisfied.  Or maybe it can be satisfied in a trivial way (nonetheless requiring this section to be shortened): DOL will allow for identifying anything of relevance in a distributed ontology, it will do so by IRIs, and with RDF there is an established mechanism for annotating things identified by IRIs.  Still I believe this requirement is an important selling point.}DOL allows for annotations in the full generality specified in \cref{c:terms-annotation}.  The DOL serializations allow for fine-grained embedding of annotations into ontologies. % up to the granularity of literate programming.

The DOL serializations also allow for annotating existing ontologies via non-intrusive standoff markup, which points to the annotation subjects from external documentation files or from special embedded comments, extending the comment syntax of the respective ontology language; for XML serializations of ontology languages, RDFa extensions are specified, so that DOL RDF can be embedded.

A list of RDF vocabularies for annotating ontologies is recommended as an annex to this international standard.


\clause{DOL abstract syntax}\label{c:abstract-syntax}
\CLnote[type=todo]{split into two clauses: one for abstract syntax, one for semantics. TM: done}


\sclause{Abstract syntax categories}

DOL provides abstract syntax categories for\todonote[author=Christoph Lange,date=D:201111071952+01'00',type=q-aut]{In the previous draft we had more fine-grained categories: ontology languages, ontology language translation, links between ontologies, ontology combination (are these the colimits that we now call ``combinations''?)}
\begin{itemize}
\item heterogeneous ontologies (which can be basic ontologies in some
ontology language, or unions, translations, minimizations, combinations,
approximations of ontologies, among others)
\item distributed ontologies (items in distributed ontologies are: ontology definitions, link definitions, and qualifications choosing the logic,
ontology language and/or serialization)
\item identifiers
\item annotations
\end{itemize}
 
Additionally, the categories of the abstract syntaxes of any conforming ontology languages (\cf \cref{c:conform:logic}) are also DOL abstract syntax categories.

The following subclauses, one per abstract syntax category, specify the abstract syntax of DOL in EBNF \nisref{ISO/IEC 14977:1996}.  Note that ISO EBNF lacks an operator for ``at least one repetition''.  This standard therefore adopts the following convention: Whenever some sequence \syntax{S} is repeated at least once, we give it a non-terminal identifier of its own (\syntax{RepeatedS = S \{ S \} ;}), or group it as in \syntax{LongerExpression = Foo Bar ( S \{ S \} ) ;}.

\sclause{Distributed Ontologies}\label{c:dist-onto}

A distributed ontology consists of at least one (possibly
heterogeneous) ontology, plus, optionally, links between its
participating (heterogeneous) ontologies.  More specifically, a
distributed ontology consists of a name, followed by a list of
\syntax{DistOntoItem}s.  A \syntax{DistOntoItem} is either an
ontology definition (\syntax{OntoDefn}), or a link between ontologies
(\syntax{LinkDefn}), or a \syntax{Qualification} selecting a specific
ontology language, logic and/or syntax that is used to interpret the
subsequent \syntax{DistOntoItem}s.  Alternatively, a distributed
ontology can also be the verbatim inclusion of an ontology written in
an ontology language that conforms with DOL (\syntax{OntoInConformingLanguage}; \cf \ref{c:conform:logic}).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=ebnf,escapeinside={<>}]

  • item-name-map (to be replaced by namespaces??)\textLF
  • lib-version (to be replaced by metadata annotations, \eg OMV)\textLF
  • indirect-link (will always use full IRIs, and abbreviate them by syntactic namespaces)}

At the beginning of a distributed ontology, one can declare a \syntax{PrefixMap} for abbreviating long IRIs; see \cref{c:identifiers} for details.

\sclause{Heterogeneous Ontologies}

An ontology (\syntax{Onto}) can be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item a basic ontology \syntax{BasicOnto} written inline, in a conforming serialization of a conforming ontology language\footnote{In this place, any ontology in a conforming serialization of a conforming ontology language is permitted.  However, DOL's module sublanguage should be given preference over the module sublanguage of the respective conforming ontology language; \eg DOL's extension construct should be preferred over OWL's import construct.},
\item a translation of an ontology into a different signature or ontology
language,
\item a reduction of an ontology to a smaller signature and/or less
expressive logic (that is,
some non-logical symbols are hidden, but the semantic effect of sentences involving these is kept),
\item an approximation of an ontology, normally in a sublogic, using a given approximation method (with the effect that sentences not expressible in the sublogic are weakened or removed),
\item a union of ontologies,
\item an extension of an ontology by other ones, it can be optionally named and/or marked as conservative, monomorphic, definitional or implied,
\item a module extracted from an ontology, using a restriction signature,
\item a reference to an ontology existing on the Web,
\item an ontology qualified with the ontology language that is used to express it,
\item a combination of ontologies (technically, this is a colimit, see \bref{ZimmermanEtAl06}),
\item a minimization of an ontology, forcing the subsequently declared
  non-logical symbols to be interpreted in a minimal way, while the non-logical symbols declared so far are fixed (alternatively, the non-logical symbols to be minimized and to be varied can be explicitly declared).

\sclause{Links}

A link provides a connection between two ontologies.
A link definition is the definition of either a named interpretation
(\syntax{IntprDefn}), a named declaration of the relation between a module of an ontology and the whole ontology (\syntax{ModuleRelDefn}), or a named alignment (\syntax{AlignDefn}).
The \syntax{SymbolMapItems} in an interpretation always
must lead to a signature morphism; a proof obligation expressing
that the (translated) source ontology logically follows from
the target ontology is generated. In contrast to this,
an alignment just provides a connection between two ontologies
without logical semantics, using a set of \syntax{Correspondence}s.
Each correspondence may map some ontology non-logical symbol to another one
(possibly given by a term) and an optional confidence value.
Moreover, the relation between the two non-logical symbols can be explicitly
specified (like being equal, or only being subsumed). 
A \syntax{ModuleRelDefn} declares that a certain ontology
actually is a module of some other ontology with respect
to the \syntax{InterfaceSignature}.

A symbol map in an interpretation is \required to cover all non-logical symbols of the source ontology; the semantics specification in \cref{c:semantics} makes this assumption\footnote{Mapping a non-logical symbol twice is an error. Mapping two source non-logical symbols to the same target non-logical symbol is legal, this then is a non-injective link.}.  Applications \shall implicitly map those non-logical symbols of the source ontology, for which an explicit mapping is not given, to non-logical symbols of the same (local) name in the target ontology, wherever this is uniquely defined – in detail:

\begin{algorithmic}
  \REQUIRE $O_s, O_t$ are ontologies
  \REQUIRE $M\subseteq\Sigma(O_s)\times\Sigma(O_t)$ maps non-logical symbols (\ie elements of the signature) of $O_s$ to non-logical symbols of $O_t$
  \FORALL{$e_s\in\Sigma(O_s)$ not covered by $M$}
    \STATE $n_s\leftarrow\operatorname{localname}(e_s)$

      \STATE $M\leftarrow M\cup\{(e_s, e_t)\}$
    \ENDIF
  \ENDFOR
  \ENSURE $M$ completely covers $\Sigma(O_s)$
\end{algorithmic}

The local name of a non-logical symbol is determined as follows\footnote{In practice, this can often have the effect of undoing an IRI abbreviation mechanism that was used when writing the respective ontologies (\cf \cref{c:identifiers}).  In general, however, functions that turn abbreviations into IRIs are not invertible.  For this reason, the implicit mapping of non-logical symbols is specified independently from IRI abbreviation mechanisms possibly employed in the ontologies.}:\hspace{-2cm}

\sclause{Identifiers}\label{c:identifiers}

This section specifies the abstract syntax of identifiers of DOL ontologies and their elements.

\ssclause{IRIs}\label{c:iris}

In accordance with best practices for publishing ontologies on the Web, identifiers of ontologies and their elements \should not just serve as \emph{names}, but also as \emph{locators}, which, when dereferenced, give access to a concrete representation of an ontology or one of its elements.  (For the specific case of RDFS and OWL ontologies, these best practices are documented in \bref{W3C:NOTE-swbp-vocab-pub-20080828}.  The latter is a specialization of the linked data principles, which apply to any machine-processable data published on the Web \bref{BernersLee:LinkedData2006}.)  It is recommended that publicly accessible DOL ontologies be published as linked data.

\todonote[type=q-aut,author=Christoph Lange]{Does this motivation/justification sound reasonable to you?}Therefore, in order to impose fewer conformance requirements on applications, DOL commits to using IRIs for identification \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987:2005}.  It is \recommended that distributed ontologies use IRIs that translate to URLs when applying the algorithm for mapping IRIs to URIs specified in \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987:2005, Section 3.1}.  DOL descriptions of any element of a distributed ontology that is identified by a certain IRI \should be \emph{located} at the corresponding URL, so that agents can locate them.  As IRIs are specified with a concrete syntax in \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987:2005}, DOL adopts the latter into its abstract syntax as well as all of its concrete syntaxes (serializations)\CLnote[type=q-all]{I meant to say: for IRIs, the abstract syntax is the same as the concrete syntax.}.

%% We don't do "semantic namespaces" for now.  (Agreed in 2012-02-23 meeting)
% For identification, DOL preferably employs IRIs that have the following three components:\footnote{This IRI syntax has originally been designed by Florian Rabe and Michael Kohlhase \bref{Rabe:MMT2011}, independently from this \IS.\todonote[type=todo,author=Christoph Lange]{if we leave this reference in place, we might additionally refer to the paper that describes the semantics of MMT and provides more design rationale background}}

% \begin{description}
% \item[namespace] an IRI that identifies the complete ontology
% \item[module] a name that identifies a module within an ontology
% \item[symbol] a name that identifies a non-logical symbol, named import, or sentence within a module\todonote[type=todo,author=Christoph Lange]{list the other things we would like to identify in this component}
% \end{description}
% It is recommended that these ``DOL IRIs'' be used whenever an ontology or a module of an ontology is primarily implemented in DOL.

In accordance with semantic web best practices such as the OWL Manchester Syntax \bref{W3C:NOTE-owl2-manchester-syntax-20091027}, this \IS does not allow relative IRIs, and does not offer a mechanism for defining a base IRI, against which relative IRIs could be resolved.

Concerning these languages, note that they allow arbitrary IRIs in principle, but in practice they strongly recommend using IRIs consisting of two components \bref{W3C:NOTE-swbp-vocab-pub-20080828}:
\begin{description}
\item[namespace] an IRI that identifies the complete ontology (a \emph{basic ontology} in DOL terminology), usually ending with \syntax{\#} or \syntax{/}
\item[local name] a name that identifies a non-logical symbol within an ontology
\end{description}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=ebnf,escapechar=@]
IRI     = 'full-iri' , FullIRI | 'curie' , CURIE@\footnote{specified below in \cref{c:curies}}@ ;
FullIRI = ? as defined by the IRI production in @\nisref{IETF/RFC 3987:2005}@ ? ;
\end{lstlisting}

\ssclause{Abbreviating IRIs using CURIEs}\label{c:curies}

As IRIs tend to be long, and as syntactic mechanisms for abbreviating them have been standardized, it is \recommended that applications employ such mechanisms and support expanding abbreviative notations into full IRIs.  For specifying the \emph{semantics} of DOL, this \IS assumes full IRIs everywhere, but the DOL abstract \emph{syntax} adopts CURIEs (compact URI expressions) as an abbreviation mechanism, as it is the most flexible one that has been standardized to date.  

The CURIE abbreviation mechanism works by binding prefixes to IRIs.  A CURIE consists of a \emph{prefix}, which may be empty, and a \emph{reference}.  If there is an in-scope binding for the prefix, the CURIE is valid and expands into a full IRI, which is created by concatenating the IRI bound to the prefix and the reference.

DOL adopts the CURIE specification of RDFa Core 1.1 \nisref{W3C/TR REC-rdfa-core-20120607, Section 6} with the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item DOL does not allow for declaring a ``default prefix'' mapping \CLnote[type=q-aut]{Are such explanatory notes OK here?}(covering CURIEs such as \syntax{:name}).
\item DOL does allow for declaring a ``no prefix'' mapping (covering CURIEs such as \syntax{name}).
\item DOL does not make use of the \syntax{safe\_curie} production.
\item DOL does not allow binding a relative IRI to a prefix.
\item Concrete syntaxes of DOL are encouraged but \notrequired to support CURIEs.\footnote{This is a concession to having an RDF-based concrete syntax among the normative concrete syntaxes.  RDFa is the only standardized RDF serialization to support CURIEs so far.  Other serializations, such as RDF/XML or Turtle, support a subset of the CURIE syntax, whereas some machine-oriented serializations, including N-Triples, only support full IRIs.}
\end{itemize}

CURIEs can occur in any place where IRIs are allowed, as stated in \cref{c:iris}.  Informatively, we can restate the CURIE grammar supported by DOL as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=ebnf,escapechar=@]
CURIE     = [ Prefix ] , Reference ;
Prefix    = NCName , ':' (* @\rm see ``NCName'' in \nisref{W3C/TR REC-xml-names:2009}, Section 3@ *) ;
Reference = Path , [ Query ] , [ Fragment ] ;
Path      = ipath-absolute | ipath-rootless | ipath-empty 
            (* @\rm as defined in \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987}@ *) ;
Query     = '?' , iquery (* @\rm as defined in \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987}@ *) ;
Fragment  = '#' , ifragment (* @\rm as defined in \nisref{IETF/RFC 3987}@ *) ;
\end{lstlisting}

Prefix mappings can be defined at the beginning of a distributed ontology (specified in \cref{c:dist-onto}; these apply to all parts of the distributed ontology, including basic ontologies as clarified in \cref{c:map-ids}).  Their syntax is:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=ebnf,escapechar=@]
PrefixMap        = 'prefix-map' , { PrefixBinding } ;
PrefixBinding    = 'prefix-binding' , BoundPrefix , IRIBoundToPrefix ;
BoundPrefix      = 'bound-prefix' , [ Prefix ] ;
IRIBoundToPrefix = 'full-iri' , FullIRI ;
\end{lstlisting}

Bindings in a prefix map are evaluated from left to right.  Authors \shouldnot bind the same prefix twice, but if they do, the later binding wins.

\ssclause{Mapping identifiers in basic ontologies to IRIs}\label{c:map-ids}

While DOL uses IRIs as identifiers throughout, basic ontology languages do not necessarily do; for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item OWL \nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-syntax:2009, Section 5.5} does use IRIs.
\item Common Logic \nisref{ISO/IEC 24707:2007} supports them but does not enforce their use.
\item F-logic \bref{flogic} does not use them at all.
\end{itemize}
However, DOL links as well as \CLnote[type=todo]{maybe clarify which ones, by checking the grammar for all occurrences of SymbolRef}certain operations on ontologies require making unambiguous references to non-logical symbols of basic ontologies (\syntax{SymbolRef}).  Therefore, DOL provides a function that maps global identifiers used within basic ontologies to IRIs.  This mapping affects all non-logical symbol identifiers (such as class names in an OWL ontology), but not locally-scoped identifiers such as bound variables in Common Logic ontologies.  DOL reuses the CURIE mechanism for abbreviating IRIs for this purpose (\cf \cref{c:curies}).

CURIEs that have a prefix may not be acceptable identifiers in every serialization of a basic ontology language, as the standard CURIE separator character, the colon (\syntax{:}), may not be allowed in identifiers.  \CLnote[type=q-all]{I recall that in the 2012-04-18 teleconference we agreed on this – but does it really make sense?  Are there any relevant ontology language serializations that do not allow : in identifiers (or that do allow it theoretically but discourage it in practice) but allow some other non-letter character?}Therefore, the declaration of DOL-conformance of the respective serialization (cf.\ \cref{c:conform:serialization}) \may define an \emph{alternative CURIE separator character}, or it \may forbid the use of prefixed CURIEs altogether.

The IRI of a non-logical symbol identifier in a basic ontology $O$ is determined by the following function:
\begin{algorithmic}
  \REQUIRE $D$ is a distributed ontology
  \REQUIRE $O$ is a basic ontology in serialization $S$
  \REQUIRE $\mathit{id}$ is the identifier in question, identifying a symbol in $O$ according to the specification of $S$
  \ENSURE $i$ is an IRI
  \IF{$\mathit{id}$ represents a full IRI according to the specification of $S$}
    \STATE $i\leftarrow\mathit{id}$
  \ELSE
    \STATE \COMMENT{first construct a pattern $\mathit{cp}$ for CURIEs in $S$, then match $\mathit{id}$ against that pattern}
    \IF{$S$ defines an alternative CURIE separator character $\mathit{cs}$}
      \STATE $\mathit{sep}\leftarrow \mathit{cs}$
    \ELSIF{$S$ forbids prefixed CURIEs}
      \STATE $\mathit{sep}\leftarrow\text{undefined}$
    \ELSE
      \STATE $\mathit{sep}\leftarrow\mathit{:}$ \COMMENT{the standard CURIE separator character}
    \ENDIF
    \STATE \COMMENT{The following statements construct a modified EBNF grammar of CURIEs; see \nisref{ISO/IEC 14977:1996} for EBNF, and \cref{c:curies} for the original grammar of CURIEs.}
    \IF{$\mathit{sep}$ is defined}
      \STATE $\mathit{cp}\leftarrow [ \mathit{NCName}, \mathit{sep} ] , \mathit{Reference}$
    \ELSE
      \STATE $\mathit{cp}\leftarrow \mathit{Reference}$
    \ENDIF 
    \IF{$\mathit{id}$ matches the pattern $\mathit{cp}$, where $\mathit{ref}$ matches $\mathit{Reference}$}
      \IF{the match succeeded with a non-empty $\mathit{NCName}$ $\mathit{pn}$}
        \STATE $p\leftarrow\mathit{concat}(pn, \mathit{:})$
      \ELSE
        \STATE $p\leftarrow\text{no prefix}$
      \ENDIF
      \IF{$O$ binds $p$ to an IRI $\mathit{pi}$ according to the specification of $S$}
        \STATE $\mathit{nsi}\leftarrow\mathit{pi}$
      \ELSE
        \STATE $P \leftarrow$ the innermost prefix map in $D$, starting from the place of $O$ inside $D$, and going up the abstract syntax tree towards the root of $D$
        \WHILE{$P$ is defined}
          \IF{$P$ binds $p$ to an IRI $\mathit{pi}$}
            \STATE $\mathit{nsi}\leftarrow\mathit{pi}$
            \STATE \textbf{break} out of the \textbf{while} loop 
          \ENDIF
          \STATE $P \leftarrow$ the next prefix map in $D$, starting from the place of the current $P$ inside $D$, and going up the abstract syntax tree towards the root of $D$
        \ENDWHILE
        \RETURN an error
      \ENDIF
      \STATE $i\leftarrow\mathit{concat}(\mathit{nsi}, \mathit{ref})$
    \ELSE
      \RETURN an error
    \ENDIF
  \ENDIF
  \RETURN $i$
\end{algorithmic}

This mechanism applies to basic ontologies given inline in a distributed ontology document (\syntax{BasicOnto}), not to ontologies in external documents (\syntax{OntoInConformingLanguage}); the latter \shall be self-contained.

While CURIEs used for identifying parts of a distributed ontology (\cf \cref{c:curies}) are merely syntactic sugar, the prefix map for a basic ontology is essential to determining the semantics of the basic ontology within the distributed ontology.  Therefore, any DOL serialization \shall provide constructs for expressing such prefix maps, even if the serialization does not support prefix maps otherwise.

Where the given ontology language does not provide a way of assigning IRIs to a desired subject of an annotation (\eg if one wants to annotate an import in OWL), a distributed ontology may employ RDF annotations that use XPointer or \nisref{IETF/RFC 5147} as means of non-destructively referencing pieces of XML or text by URI.\footnote{We intend to utilise the extensibility of the XPointer framework by developing additional XPointer schemes, \eg for pointing to subterms of Common Logic sentences.}

\clause{DOL semantics}\label{c:semantics}

We pursue a threefold approach of assigning a semantics to the DOL
abstract syntax:

\begin{description}
\item[Direct Model-Theoretic Semantics] On the level of basic
  ontologies, this semantics reuses the existing semantics of the
  involved logics, as well as translations between these logics.  The
  semantics of structured DOL ontologies and links is specified on
  top of this.
\item[Translational Semantics] The semantics of Common Logic is
  employed for all basic ontology languages, taking advantage of the
  fact that Common Logic is a common translation target for many
  ontology languages.  In detail, the translational semantics first
  translates the DOL abstract syntax of into the abstract syntax of
  $DOL(\CL)$, where $DOL(\CL)$ is the homogeneous restriction of DOL
  to distributed ontologies with all parts written in Common Logic
  only.  The latter is interpreted as in the case of the direct
  semantics, with basic ontologies interpreted in terms of the
  existing Common Logic semantics.
\item[Collapsed Semantics] The collapsed semantics extends the
  translational semantics to a semantics that is fully given specified
  in Common Logic.  It further translates the abstract syntax
  $DOL(\CL)$ to Common Logic, and then reuses the semantics of Common
  Logic, without employing a separate semantics for the DOL language.
  Here, the meta and object levels are collapsed into Common Logic,
  but may still be distinguished by a closer look into the Common
  Logic theory.

\end{description}

The model-theoretic nature of the semantics ensures a better representation
of the model theory than a theory-level semantics would do. In particular,
Theorem~13 of \bref{ThreeSemantics} ensures that models classes of logical 
theories represented in Common Logic can be recovered through a model
translation. This is of particular importance when studying model-theoretic
properties like finite model or tree model properties.




We now specify the theoretical foundations of the semantics
of DOL.\CLnote[type=todo]{later on we also need to say
  something about the semantics of the syntax. TM: what is this?} Since DOL involves
heterogeneous ontologies, the semantics is parameterised over an
arbitrary but fixed \emph{heterogeneous logic environment}.  This
notion is defined below, it corresponds to a graph of ontology
languages and ontology language translations. Below, also notions of
\emph{institute} and \emph{institute comorphism} are defined, which
provide formalisations of the terms ``logic'',
resp.\ ``logic translation''. 

The notion of institute deliberately avoids the use of category theory
in order to keep the mathematical background simple.  Most of the
abstract syntax can be interpreted using institutes, but not all of
it. Some parts (namely symbol maps, \syntax{combination}s
 and the construct \syntax{monomorphic};
these are marked in {\institutionsOnly bold italics}) of the abstract
syntax need a more sophisticated and more general category-theoretic
foundation in terms of institutions [\bref{Institutions}]. More
specifically, the notion of institute needs to be replaced by that of
institutional logic [\bref{Meseguer89}], and analogously for
comorphisms [\bref{Comorphisms}].
% and the Grothendieck construction [\bref{GrothendieckInstitutions}].

Details of the mapping of the abstract syntax into the semantic
domains given by the heterogeneous logic environment will be provided later.

%An extension of this semantic background to non-monotonic logics,
%using the theory of [\bref{ArieliAvron2000}], needs still to be worked out.

We recall the notion of satisfaction system
\bref{carnielli2008analysis}, called `rooms' in the terminology of
\bref{CharPar}. They capture the Tarskian notion of satisfaction of a
sentence in a model. For the semantics of minimization,
we assume a pre-order on models.

\begin{definition}\label{def:room}
A triple $\cR=(Sen,{\cM,\models)}$  is called a  \defsty{satisfaction system}, or \defsty{room}, if $\cR$  consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a set $Sen$ of \defsty{sentences},
\item a pre-ordered class
%\footnote{If we want to take model morphisms into account, 
%a \emph{category} of models needs to be given here. However, this is important only
%for the \syntax{\%mono} annotation.}
$\cM$ of \defsty{models}, and
\item a binary relation
${\models}\subseteq \cM \times Sen$, called the \defsty{satisfaction relation}.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\eat{
Two sentences are \emph{semantically
equivalent}, written $\varphi_1\bimodels\varphi_2$, if they are satisfied by
the same models.  Two models are \emph{elementary equivalent}, written
$M_1\equiv M_2$, if they satisfy the same sentences.  A room is
\emph{compact\/} iff $\Delta\models_\Sigma\varphi$ implies
$\Delta'\models_\Sigma\varphi$ for some finite subset $\Delta'$ of $\Delta$.
}

While this signature-free treatment enjoys simplicity and is
wide-spread in the literature, many concepts and definitions found in
logics, e.g.\ the notion of a conservative extension, involve the
\emph{vocabulary} or \emph{signature} $\Sigma$ \label{vocabulary} used
in sentences.  Signatures can be extended with new non-logical symbols;
abstractly, this leads to an ordering relation on signatures.

\begin{definition}\label{def:sigroom}
An \defsty{institute} $\cI=(Sig,\leq,Sen,\cM,\models)$ is a signature-indexed room, i.e.\ consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a preorder $(Sig,\leq)$ of signatures;
\item a room $(Sen,\cM,\models)$;
\item a function $sig: Sen\to Sig$, giving the (minimal) signature
of a sentence;
\item a function $sig: Mod\to Sig$, giving the signature
of a model, 
\item for any $\Sigma_2$-model $M$, a $\Sigma_1$-model
  $M\forget{\Sigma_1}$ (called the \defsty{reduct}), provided that
  $\Sigma_1\leq\Sigma_2$,
\end{itemize}
such that the following properties hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item given $\Sigma_1\leq\Sigma_2$, for any $\Sigma_2$-model $M$
and any $\Sigma_1$-sentence $\varphi$
$$M\models\varphi\mbox{ iff }M\forget{\Sigma_1}\models\varphi$$
(satisfaction is \defsty{invariant under reduct}),
\item for any $\Sigma$-model, $M\forget{\Sigma}=M$, 
and given $\Sigma_1\leq\Sigma_2\leq\Sigma$, 
$$(M\forget{\Sigma_2})\forget{\Sigma_1}=M\forget{\Sigma_1}$$ 
(\defsty{reducts are compositional}), and
\item for any model $M$ and sentence $\varphi$,
$$M\models\varphi\mbox{ implies }sig(M)\geq sig(\varphi)$$
(\defsty{signature coherence}).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Here, the class of models over a signature $\Sigma$ (short:
$\Sigma$-models) is defined as 
$$Mod(\Sigma):=\{M\in\cM | sig(M)=\Sigma\}$$ 
Note that we here require equality of signature, unlike we
did for sentences.  The reason is that a model always needs to
interpret all of the non-logical symbols of a signature (and not more), while a
sentence might use only part of the non-logical symbols of the signature.

\begin{example}\label{Prop} 
  \defsty{Propositional Logic} is an institute as follows: Signatures in $\Prop$ are just sets
  $\Sigma$ (of propositional non-logical symbols) as signatures, and signature
  inclusion is just set inclusion. A $\Sigma$-model $M$ is a mapping
  from $\Sigma$ to $\{\mathit{true},\mathit{false}\}$.
  $\Sigma$-sentences are built from $\Sigma$ with the usual
  propositional connectives.  Finally, satisfaction of a sentence in a
  model is defined by the standard truth-table semantics.
\end{example}

Further examples of institutes are: $\mathcal{SROIQ}(D)$, Common
Logic, unsorted first-order logic, many-sorted first-order logic, and
many others.  Note that reduct is generally given by forgetting parts
of the model, and the pre-order on models is given as follows:
$M_1\leq M_2$ if $M_1$ and $M_2$ only differ in the interpretation of
propositional non-logical symbols and predicates, and moreover each propositional
(and predicate) symbol true in $M_1$ is also true in $M_2$ (for a
given tuple of arguments).

Assume an arbitrary institute.

A \defsty{theory} is a set $\Delta\subseteq Sen$ of sentences
It is \defsty{consistent\/} iff it has at least one model.
A theory $\Delta\subseteq Sen$ is \defsty{satisfiable}, if it has a model
$M$ (i.e., a model $M \in \cM$
such that $M\models\varphi$ for $\varphi\in\Delta$).
%Also,
\defsty{Semantic entailment} is defined as usual: for 
a theory $\Delta\subseteq Sen$ and $\varphi\in Sen$, we write
$\Delta\models\varphi$, if all models satisfying all sentences in
$\Delta$ also satisfy $\varphi$.


\begin{lemma}[Coincidence Lemma]
  Let $\Delta$ be a theory with $sig(\Delta)=\Sigma$, and $\varphi$ a
  sentence. For determining whether the semantic entailment
  $\Delta\models\varphi$ holds, it suffices to consider
  $\Sigma$-models only.
\end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   Assume that all $\Sigma$-models satisfying $\Delta$ also satisfy
%   $\varphi$.  Let $M$ be any model satisfying $\Delta$. By signature
%   coherence, $sig(M)\geq \Sigma$.  By invariance of satisfaction
%   under reduct, $M\forget\Sigma\models\Delta$.  Hence by assumption,
%   $M\forget\Sigma\models\varphi$. Again by invariance,
%   $M\models\varphi$.
% \end{proof}

Corridors are the links between rooms. A corridor maps both sentences
and models (syntax and semantics). Models are mapped in reverse
direction. The rationale behind this is as follows: usually, the
target room is either logically more expressive or well-suited for
logical coding. Sentences of the source room are represented, or coded
in the target room. Models of the target room are usually richer, so
that from a model in the target room, a model in the source room can
be extracted.
\begin{definition}\label{def:corridor}
A \defsty{corridor}
$
(\alpha,\beta)\map{(Sen_1,\cM_1,\models_1)}{(Sen_2,\cM_2,\models_2)}
$
 consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a sentence translation function $\alpha\map{Sen_1}{Sen_2}$, and
\item a model reduction function
%\footnote{If model morphisms are taken into account, then a functor.} 
$\beta\map{\cM_2}{\cM_1}$, 
such that
\end{itemize}
$$M_2\models_2 \alpha(\varphi_1) \mbox{ if and only if } 
\beta(M_2)\models_1 \varphi_1$$
holds for each $M_2\in \cM_2$ and each $\varphi_1\in Sen_1$
(\defsty{satisfaction condition}).

A \defsty{partial corridor} is one where $\beta$ is partial,
and the satisfaction condition is only required for those $M_2$
such that $\beta(M_2)$ is defined.
\end{definition}
A corridor is called \defsty{model-expansive}, if $\beta$ is a surjection.

\begin{definition}[Relative Interpretation]
  Given $\Delta_i$ a theory in $\cR_i\;(i=1,2)$, a corridor $(\alpha,\beta):\cR_1\to \cR_2$ is a \textbf{relative interpretation}, if
\[
\beta(\Mod(\Delta_2))\subseteq \Mod(\Delta_1)
\]
\end{definition}

Institute comorphisms capture the intuition of translating a
logic into another one. They extend corridors by mapping also signatures.
\begin{definition}\label{def:sigroom-co}
Given institutes 
$\cI_1=(Sig_1,\leq_1,Sen_1,\cM_1,\models_1)$ and
$\cI_2=(Sig_2,\leq_2,Sen_2,\cM_2,$ ${\models_2)}$,
an \defsty{institute comorphism}  $\rho=(\Phi,\alpha,\beta):\cI_1\longrightarrow 
\cI_2$
 consists of
\begin{itemize}
  \item a monotone map $\Phi:(Sig^1,\leq^1)\to(Sig^2,\leq^2)$, and
  \item a partial corridor
  $(\alpha,\beta):{(Sen_1,\cM_1,\models_1)}\to {(Sen_2,\cM_2,\models_2)}$
\end{itemize}
such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item  $sig^2(\alpha(\varphi_1))\leq \Phi(sig^1(\varphi_1))$
  for any sentence $\varphi_1\in Sen^1$;
  \item for each $\cI_1$-signature $\Sigma$, $\beta$ restricts to
a total function $\beta_\Sigma:Mod_2(\Phi(\Sigma))\to Mod_1(\Sigma)$;
 \item model translation commutes with reduct, that is,
given $\Sigma_1\leq\Sigma_2$ in $\cI_1$ and a $\Phi(\Sigma_2)$-model
 $M$ in $\cI_2$,
$$\beta_{\Sigma_2}(M)\forget{\Sigma_1}=\beta_{\Sigma_1}(M\forget{\Phi(\Sigma_1)}).$$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
An institute comorphism is called \defsty{model-expansive}, if
all $\beta_\Sigma$ are surjective.

A \defsty{subinstitute comorphism} is a institute comorphism
$(\Phi,\alpha,\beta)\map{\cI_1}{\cI_2}$ with $\Phi$ injective and
preorder-reflecting, $\alpha$ injective and $\beta_\Sigma$ bijective
for each $\Sigma$. In this case, $\cI_1$ is said to be a
\defsty{subinstitute} of $\cI_2$.

A \defsty{simple theoroidal comorphism} is like a comorphism, except
that the signature translation functor $\Phi$ maps signatures to
\emph{theories} over the target institute.

Institute morphisms capture the intuition of reducing a logic into
another one, and are used for logic reductions.

\begin{definition}\label{def:sigroom-co}
Given institutes 
$\cI_1=(Sig_1, \leq_1,Sen_1,\cM_1,\models_1)$ and
$\cI_2=(Sig_2,\leq_2,Sen_2,\cM_2,$ ${\models_2)}$,
an \defsty{institute morphism}  $\mu=(\Phi,\alpha,\beta):\cI_1\longrightarrow 
\cI_2$
 consists of
\begin{itemize}
  \item a monotone map $\Phi:(Sig^1,\leq^1)\to(Sig^2,\leq^2)$, and
  \item a partial corridor
  $(\alpha,\beta):{(Sen_2,\cM_2,\models_2)}\to {(Sen_1,\cM_1,\models_1)}$
\end{itemize}
such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item  $\Phi(sig^1(\alpha(\varphi_2)))\leq sig^2(\varphi_2)$
  for any sentence $\varphi_2\in Sen^2$;
  \item for each $\cI_1$-signature $\Sigma$, $\beta$ restricts to
a total function $\beta_\Sigma:Mod_1(\Phi(\Sigma))\to Mod_2(\Sigma)$;
 \item model translation commutes with reduct, that is,
given $\Sigma_1\leq\Sigma_2$ in $\cI_1$ and a $\Sigma_2$-model
 $M$,
$$\beta_{\Sigma_2}(M)\forget{\Phi(\Sigma_1)}=\beta_{\Sigma_1}(M\forget{\Sigma_1}).$$

\sclause{Direct semantics of DOL language constructs}

The semantics of DOL is based on a fixed (but in principle arbitrary)
heterogeneous logical environment is assumed.  The semantic domains
are based on this heterogeneous logical environement. A specific
heterogeneous logical environment is given in the annexes.

A heterogeneous logical enviroment is given by a collection of
ontology languages and ontology language translations\footnote{The
  terms \emph{ontology language} and \emph{serialization} are not
  defined formally. For this semantics, it suffices to know that there
  is a language-specific semantics of basic ontologies as defined
  below.}, a collection of institutes, institute morphisms and
institute comorphisms (serving as logics, logic reductions and logic
translations), and a collection of serializations. Moreover, there is
a binary supports relation between ontology languages and institutes,
and a binary supports relation between ontology languages and
serializations. Some of the comorphisms are marked as default
translations.

For pairs of institutes $\cI_1$ and $\cI_2$, we assume a pair of
default union institute comorphisms
$(\Phi_i,\alpha_i,\beta_i)\map{\cI_i}{\cI}$ into a common target
institute. The default union may also be undefined.


We also assume a language-specific semantics of basic
ontologies, depending on a triple $L=(lang,logic,ser)$ comprising of
an ontology language, a logic (institute) and a serialization as follows:
\semdom{sem_L(\Sigma,\syntax{BasicOnto})=(\Sigma',\Delta')\mbox{
    where } \Sigma'\geq\Sigma} This is given by semantics of
\syntax{BasicOnto} in $L$. The signature $\Sigma$ is the \emph{local
  environment} of non-logical symbols that have been declared previously to
\syntax{BasicOnto}. $\Sigma'\geq\Sigma$ is an extension of $\Sigma$
with the non-logical symbols declared in \syntax{BasicOnto}.  $\Delta'$ is a set
of sentences over $\Sigma'$.

We further assume a language-specific semantics of complete (possibly
structured) ontologies
$sem(L,\syntax{OntoInSpecificLanguage})=(\Sigma,\cM)$, where
$\Sigma$ is a signature and $\cM$ a class of models over $\Sigma$.

We assume that in each institute there is a trivial signature
$\emptyset$ with model class $\cM_\emptyset$. Moreover, we assume that
for each signature $\Sigma$, there is a set of non-logical symbols $ent(\Sigma)$,
such that $\Sigma\leq\Sigma'$ implies $ent(\Sigma)\subseteq
ent(\Sigma')$.
This concludes the definition of heterogeneous logical enviroment.

The semantics of ontologies generally depends on a global environment
$\Gamma$ mapping \syntax{IRI}s to semantics of ontologies (given
below), and a current triple $L$ consisting of the current
language, logic and serialization.\footnote{The initial $L$ is obtained
from the file name extension of the file containing a 
particular distributed ontology, while $\Gamma$ is obtained
by looking up IRIs in the internet and applying the semantics
to thus obtained ontologies.}

  It seems that the individual ontologies are directly named with
  IRIs, and the \syntax{DistOntoName} is not relevant for that?
  Answer from telco: The \syntax{DistOntoName} is an IRI that should (as a
  good practice, but not enforced) agree with the IRI of the document.
  Indeed, this applies to any usage of IRI in the standard. This
  should be stated in the standard (Christoph). (This is known as
  "linked data compliance", a good practice to be encouraged but not
  to be enforced, as it would break a lot of old ontologies)}

 Note that ``the unique language supporting \syntax{LogicRef}'' may
 be undefined; in this case, the semantics of the whole
 \syntax{'logic-select' , LogicRef} construct is undefined.

$sem((lang,logic,ser),\syntax{'logic-select' , SyntaxRef})=(lang,logic,\syntax{SyntaxRef})$\\
The semantics is defined only if $\mathit{lang}$ supports \syntax{SyntaxRef}.

where $L'=sem(L,\syntax{Qualification})$.

Equations for \syntax{OntoDefn} and \syntax{LinkDefn} are given below.

\semdom{sem(\Gamma,L,(\Sigma,\cM),\syntax{MinimizableOnto})=(I,\Sigma',\cM')}

In the context of a global environment $\Gamma$,
the current language, logic and serialization $L$,  and a local environment $(\Sigma,\cM)$ (of previously declared
non-logical symbols), an ontology (\syntax{MinimizableOnto})
$O$ is intepreted as an institute $\cI=logic(\Gamma,L,O)$, a signature $\Sigma=sig(\Gamma,L,O)$ in institute $\cI$ and a class
of models $\cM=Mod(\Gamma,L,O)$ over signature $\Sigma$.
We combine this into $sem(\Gamma,L,O)=(logic(\Gamma,L,O),sig(\Gamma,L,O),Mod(\Gamma,L,O))$.

$sem(\Gamma,L,(\Sigma,\cM),\syntax{BasicOnto})=(L,\Sigma',\{M'\in Mod(\Sigma')\, |\, M\models\Delta', M'\forget\Sigma\in\cM \})$,\\  where
$sem_L(\Sigma,\syntax{BasicOnto})=(\Sigma',\Delta')$

$sem(\Gamma,L,(\Sigma,\cM),\syntax{'onto-ref' , OntoRef})= \Gamma(\syntax{OntoRef})$

Note that $\Gamma(\syntax{OntoRef})$ may be undefined. That is, if a
reference (IRI) to an ontology is not defined, the semantics of the
enclosing DOL construct is undefined.

\semdom{sem(\Gamma,L,(\Sigma,\cM),\syntax{ExtendingOnto})=(\cI,\Sigma',\cM')}

Semantics for \syntax{MinimizableOnto} is inherited.

The semantics for minimization selects the models that are minimal
in the class of all models with the same interpretation for the
local environment (= fixed non-logical symbols, in the terminology of circumscription).

$sem(\Gamma,L,(\Sigma,\cM),\syntax{'minimize' , MinimizableOnto}) = (\cI,\Sigma',\cM'')$, \\
where
$(\Sigma',\cM')=sem(\Gamma,L,(\Sigma,\cM),\syntax{MinimizableOnto})$\\
and $\cM''=\{M\in \cM'\, |\, M\textrm{ is minimal in }\{M'\in \cM'\, |\,M'\forget\Sigma=M\forget\Sigma\}\}$


\semdom{sem(\Gamma,L,\syntax{Onto})=(\cI,\Sigma,\cM)}

\syntax{Onto} is interpreted in a context similar to that for
\syntax{MinimizableOnto}; the difference being that there is
no local environment.

\sclause{Translational semantics of DOL language constructs}

The translational semantics uses Common Logic as a foundational framework
for the distributed ontology language DOL, similar to what set theory
provides for general mathematical theories. This semantics assumes
that each involved ontology language is mapped to \Clogic by a weakly
exact translation.  The semantics is defined by first translating a
heterogeneous ontology to \Clogic, and then using the direct
semantics for the result.

Note that since the result of translating a DOL ontology entirely to
\Clogic is homogeneous, the clause for logic translation of the direct
semantics will not be used. Using default logic translations and
compositions of these, many logics can be mapped to Common Logic,
while the DOL constructs like interpretations stay the
same.\footnote{The translational semantics is not applicable
for logics without a default translation of Common Logic.}%\ednote{OK: what about $\meta(\CL)$, what about interpretations/views?}

We define the syntactic translation $CL_\rho$ of DOL ontologies,
depending on a logic translation $\rho:L\to\CL$, to Common Logic below. (The
translations of the other syntactic categories are straightforward.)

\todonote{Extend this to all DOL constructs}
\smallskip
$\begin{array}{l}
CL_\rho(\BASICONTO)=\langle\Phi(\Sigma),\alpha(\Delta)\rangle,
\mbox{ where }
 \rho=(\Phi,\alpha,\beta)\\
CL_\rho(O\syntax{ with logic }\rho')=CL_{\rho\circ\rho'}(O)\\
CL_\rho(O\syntax{ then }CS\ \BASICONTO)=CL_\rho(O)\syntax{ then }CS\ \ CL_\rho(\syntax{\BASICONTO})\\
CL_\rho(\syntax{OntoRef})=\syntax{OntoRef}\\
CL_\rho(\syntax{logic LogicRef }O)=CL_{\mathit{default}(\syntax{LogicRef},\CL)}(O)\\
\end{array}$

%\noindent
%Given a logic $L$, we define $CL_L(O)$ as 
%$CL_{\mathit{default}(L,\CL)}(O)$.

\sclause{Collapsed Semantics of DOL language constructs}
\label{sec:collapsed-semantics}

The collapsed semantics requires the representation of the meta level
within \CL. For this purpose, the model-level semantics introduced in
the previous section should be complemented by a theory-level
semantics: a distributed ontology then denotes a basic theory in some
logic (which amounts to flattening out all structure), plus some
conditions for conservativity and relative interpretations. For each
logic, one needs to axiomatise a specific partial order of signatures
in \CL, plus a set of sentences equipped with a logical consequence
relation. In order to avoid the formalisation of models and the
satisfaction relation (which would require the inclusion of a set theory
like ZFC), a sound and complete calculus is axiomatised for each logic.
%\ednote{TM: perhaps state a theorem about the compatibility
%  between model-level and theory-level semantics?} 
For each logic
translation, the signature and sentence translations need to be
axiomatised. We require that this axiomatisation is done in such a way that
the resulting semantics is compatible with the translational semantics.
Although this formalisation is doable in principle, we refrain form
providing the (massive) details.  

%\ednote{OK: non-classical reasoning tasks (lcs) in collapsed semantics}

\todonote[type=q-all]{The collapsed semantics is still very vague, and
  is more a research plan than a definite proposal. Any ideas how to
  make this more precise?}

~\CLnote{Given the agreement to drop the RDF serialization, this is obsolete.  Still I need to revise it, as part of this may be relevant w.r.t.\ the registry vocabulary.}

\sclause{Document type}

DOL RDF does not have one specific document type; instead, it may be represented in any RDF serialization, for example RDF/XML, whose MIME type is \mimetype{application/rdf+xml}.

\begin{description}
\item[RDF namespace] \url{http://purl.net/dol/1.0/rdf#}
\end{description}

For reasons of practical applicability, the RDF vocabulary is given as an OWL ontology\footnote{The implementation is available for download as RDF/XML from the namespace URL given above, or as a source file in OWL Manchester Syntax from \url{http://interop.cim3.net/file/pub/OntoIOp/Working_Draft/syntax/dol-rdf.omn}.}.  The RDFS subset of this OWL ontology is normative; all features beyond that are informative but intended to be useful for applications supporting DOL.

About mapping identifiers in basic ontologies to IRIs (\cref{c:map-ids}), note that prefix maps are not part of the RDF abstract syntax.  Therefore, to prevent loss of this semantically essential information, the DOL RDF serialization provides a dedicated vocabulary for expressing prefix maps.  A DOL ontology in an RDF serialization that supports prefix maps \may state them redundantly as syntactic RDF prefixes as well as using the DOL RDF vocabulary.

\normannex{Conformance of OWL 2 with DOL}\label{a:owl}

The semantic conformance of OWL 2 (as specified in \nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-syntax:2009}) with DOL is established in \bref{OntoGraph}.

The OWL XML serialization satisfies the criteria for XML conformance.  The mapping of OWL 2 to RDF graphs satisfies the criteria for RDF conformance\CLnote{This is not exactly true, as some things, e.g. imports, can't be identified.}.  The OWL 2 Manchester syntax satisfies the criteria for text conformance.
~\CLnote{also need conformance propositional logic; use PL ``profile'' of the CASL ``IFIP standard''}

OWL can be formalised as an institute as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{DL} \defsty{\OWL2 DL.} 
\OWL~2~DL is the description logic (DL) based fragment of the web ontology language \OWL 2. 
We start with the simple description logic $\ALC$, and then proceed
to the more complex description logic \SROIQ which is underlying \OWL~2~DL.
Signatures of the description logic $\ALC$ consist of a set  ${\mathcal A}$ of
atomic concepts, a set ${\mathcal R}$ of roles and a set ${\mathcal
I}$ of individual constants. The partial order on signatures is defined
as component wise inclusion.
  Models are 
 first-order structures $I = (\Delta^I, .^I)$ with universe $\Delta^I$
that interpret concepts as unary and roles as binary predicates
(using $.^I$). $I_1\leq I_2$ if $\Delta^{I_1}=\Delta^{I_2}$ and all
concepts and roles of $I_1$ are subconcepts and subroles of those in $I_2$.
Sentences are subsumption relations $C_1\sqsubseteq C_2$ between
concepts, where concepts follow the grammar\CLnote[type=q-aut]{This grammar should also be adapted to ISO EBNF.}
$$C ::= {\mathcal A} \,|\, \top\,|\, \bot \,|\, C_1 \sqcup C_2 \,|\, C_1 \sqcap C_2 \,|\, \neg C 
    \,|\, \forall R . C \,|\, \exists R . C$$
These kind of sentences are also called TBox sentences.
 Sentences can also be ABox sentences, which are
membership assertions of individuals in concepts (written $a:C$ for
$a\in{\mathcal I})$ or pairs of individuals in roles (written $R(a,b)$
for $a,b\in{\mathcal I}, R\in{\mathcal R}$).   Satisfaction is the
standard satisfaction of description logics.

The logic \SROIQ \bref{SROIQ}, which is the logical core of the Web Ontology
Language \OWL 2 DL\footnote{See also \url{http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/}}, extends $\ALC$ with the following
constructs: (i) complex role inclusions such as $R \circ S \sqsubseteq S$
as well as simple role hierarchies such as $R \sqsubseteq S$,
assertions for symmetric, transitive, reflexive, asymmetric and
disjoint roles (called RBox sentences, denoted by $\mathcal{SR}$), as well as the construct
$\exists R . \mathsf{Self}$ (collecting the set of `$R$-reflexive
points'); (ii) nominals, i.e.\ concepts of the form $\{a\}$, where $a\in\mathcal{I}$ (denoted by $\mathcal{O}$); (iii) inverse
roles (denoted by $\mathcal{I}$); qualified and unqualified number
restrictions ($\mathcal{Q}$). For details on the rather complex
grammatical restrictions for \SROIQ (e.g.\ regular role inclusions,
simple roles) compare \bref{SROIQ}.

\OWL \emph{profiles} are syntactic restrictions of \OWL~2~DL that support specific modelling and reasoning tasks, %\cite{w3c:owl2-profiles}, 
and which are accordingly based on DLs with appropriate computational properties. Specifically, \OWL~2~\EL is designed for ontologies containing large numbers of concepts or relations, \OWL~2~\QL to support query answering over large amounts of data, and \OWL~2~\RL to support scalable reasoning using rule languages (\EL, \QL, and \RL for short) .
 
We sketch the logic \ELDL which is underlying the \EL profile.\footnote{To be exact, \EL adds various `harmless' expressive means and syntactic sugar to \ELDL resulting in the DL \ELDL$++$. % \cite{BaaderEtAl-OWLED08DC}; for further details see also \cite{w3c:owl2-profiles}.
} 
\ELDL is a syntactic restriction of \ALC to existential restriction, concept
intersection, and the top concept:
%\ednote{TM@OK: please be  a bit more precise here, perhaps write some grammar: C ::= ⊤ | A | C ⊓ D | ∃r.C, footnote about added sugar in OWL EL profile} Note that \EL is a very relevant ontology language; large medical ontologies like SNOMED\ednote{CL@TM: FYI, it's SNO not SNOW} CT are epxressed in \EL.\ednote{TM@OK: add RL and QL if there is space}
%\ednote{Text entfernt: ``I.e.\ its concepts follow the following grammar'' -- versteht sich IMHO von selbst, nachdem man das obige \ALC-Beispiel gelesen hat}
$$C ::= {\mathcal A} \,|\, \top \,|\,  C_1 \sqcap C_2 \,|\, \exists R . C$$
Note that \ELDL does not have disjunction or negation, and is therefore a sub-Boolean logic.

\normannex{Conformance of Common Logic with DOL}\label{a:cl}

The semantic conformance of Common Logic (as specified in \nisref{ISO/IEC 24707:2007}) with DOL is established in \bref{OntoGraph}.

The XCF dialect of Common Logic has a serialization that satisfies the criteria for XML conformance.  The CLIF dialect of Common Logic has a serialization that satisfies the criteria for text conformance.

Common Logic can be defined as an institute as follows:

\begin{definition}\label{CommonLogic} \defsty{Common Logic.}  
A common logic signature
$\Sigma$ (called vocabulary in Common Logic terminology) consists of a
set of names, with a subset called the set of discourse names, and a
set of sequence markers. An inclusion of signatures needs to fulfil the
requirement that a name is a discourse
name in the smaller signature if and only if it is one in the larger signature.  A $\Sigma$-model $I=(\UR,\UD,\rel,\fun,\intCL)$ consists of a set $\UR$,
the universe of reference, with a non-empty subset $\UD\subseteq \UR$,
the universe of discourse, and four mappings:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item $\rel$ from $\UR$ to subsets of $\UD^* = \{<x_1,\ldots,x_n> |
x_1,\ldots,x_n \in \UD\}$ (i.e., the set of finite sequences of
elements of $\UD$);
   \item $\fun$ from $\UR$ to total functions from $\UD^*$ into $\UD$;
   \item $\intCL$ from names in $\Sigma$ to $\UR$, such that
$\intCL(v)$ is in $\UD$ if and only if $v$ is a discourse name;
   \item $\seq$ from sequence markers in $\Sigma$ to $\UD^*$.
  \end{itemize}  A $\Sigma$-sentence is a first-order
sentence, where predications and function applications are written
in a higher-order like syntax: $t(s)$.
Here, $t$ is an arbitrary term, and $s$ is a sequence term, which can
be a sequence of terms $t_1\ldots t_n$, or a sequence marker.
A predication $t(s)$ is interpreted by evaluating the term $t$,
mapping it to a relation using $\rel$, and then asking whether the sequence
given by the interpretation $s$ is in this relation.  
Similarly, a function application $t(s)$ is interpreted using $\fun$.
Otherwise, interpretation of terms and formulae is as in
first-order logic. 
A further
difference is the presence of sequence terms (namely sequence markers and
juxtapositions of terms), which denote sequences in $\UD^*$, with term
juxtaposition interpreted by sequence concatenation.
Note that sequences are essentially a non-first-order feature that
can be expressed in second-order logic.

Model reducts are defined in the following way: 
Given a signature inclusion $\Sigma'\leq\Sigma$ and a $\Sigma$-model
$I=(\UR,\UD,\rel,\fun,\intCL)$, $I\forget{\Sigma'}=(\UR',\UD,\rel',\fun',\intCL')$ is defined by
\begin{itemize}
\item $UR'$ is the restriction of $\UR$ to those elements satisfying the
following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item they are not in the universe of discourse $\UD$;
\item they are the interpretation (according to $\intCL$) of a non-discourse name in $\Sigma$;
\item they are not the interpretation (according to $\intCL$) of a non-discourse name in $\Sigma'$.
\end{enumerate}
\item $\rel'$ is $\rel$ restricted to $\UR'$;
\item $\fun'$ is $\fun$ restricted to $\UR'$;
\item $\intCL'$ is $\intCL$ restricted to $\Sigma'$.
\end{itemize}

Note that with this notion of reduct, extensions commonly understood
as definitions in segregated dialects of Common Logic are indeed both
definitional and conservative extensions.

\todonote{Ordering on models! Universes agree, $\fun_1(x)= \fun_2(x)$, $\rel_1(x)\subseteq \rel_2(x)$, $\intCL_1(n)=\intCL_2(n)$
}

%For details, see \cite{CommonLogic:oldfashioned}.
We call the restriction of \CL to sentence
without sequence markers \CLminus.
\end{definition}


\normannex{Conformance of RDF and RDFS with DOL}\label{a:rdfs}

The semantic conformance of RDFS (as specified in \nisref{W3C/TR REC-rdf-schema:2004}) with DOL is established in \bref{OntoGraph}.

The way of representing RDFS ontologies as RDF graphs satisfies the criteria for RDF conformance.


\begin{definition}[\RDF and \RDFS]
Following \bref{Lucanu}, 
we define the institutions for the Resource Description
Framework (\RDF) and \RDF-Schema (\RDFS), respectively. 
These are based on a logic called \emph{bare} \RDF (\SimpleRDF), which consists
of triples only (without any predefined resources).

%%%%%%%%%%
A \textit{signature} $\mathbf{R_s}$ in \SimpleRDF is a set of
\textit{resource references}. For $sub, pred, obj \in \mathbf{R_s}$, a
triple of the form $(sub, pred, obj)$ is a \textit{sentence} in \SimpleRDF,
where $sub$, $pred$, $obj$ represent subject name, predicate name,
object name, respectively. An $\mathbf{R_s}$-model $M =
\langle R_m, P_m, S_m, EXT_m \rangle$ consists of a \textit{set $R_m$
  of resources}, a set $P_m \subseteq R_m$ of predicates, a
\textit{mapping function} $S_m:\mathbf{R_s} \rightarrow R_m$, and an
\textit{extension function} $EXT_m: P_m \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(R_m
\times R_m)$ mapping every predicate to a set of pairs of
resources. Satisfaction is defined as follows:
%
\[\mathfrak{M} \models_{\mathbf{R_s}} (sub, pred, obj) \Leftrightarrow (S_{m}(sub),
(S_{m}(obj)) \in EXT_{m} (S_m(pred)). \]
%%%%%
%
Both \RDF and \RDFS are built on top of \SimpleRDF by fixing a certain
standard vocabulary both as part of each signature and in the models.\ednote{Refer to the RDF standard here.}
Actually, the standard vocabulary is given by a certain theory. In case
of \RDF, it contains e.g.\ resources \texttt{rdf:type} and
\texttt{rdf:Property} and \texttt{rdf:subject}, and sentences like e.g.\
$(\texttt{rdf:type},\texttt{rdf:type},$ $ \texttt{rdf:Property})$, and $(\texttt{rdf:subject}, \texttt{rdf:type},$  $\texttt{rdf:Property})$.

In the models, the standard vocabulary is interpreted with a fixed
model.  Moreover, for each $\RDF$-model $M = \langle R_m, P_m, S_m,
EXT_m \rangle$, if $p\in P_m$, then it must hold
$(p,S_m(\texttt{rdf:Property}))\in EXT_m(\texttt{rdf:type})$.
For \RDFS, similar conditions are formulated (here, for example also
the subclass relation is fixed).


In the case of \RDFS, the standard vocabulary contains more elements,
like
rdf:domain,
rdf:range, rdf:Resource, rdf:Literal, rdf:Datatype, rdf:Class,
rdf:subClassOf, rdf:subPropertyOf, rdf:member, rdf:Container,
rdf:ContainerMembershipProperty.

There is also \OWL full, an extension of \RDFS with resources
like owl:Thing and owl:oneOf, tailored towards the representation of
\OWL.

\sclause{\EL $\to$ $\OWL$ and $\ELDL++$ $\to$ $\SROIQ(D)$}

\EL $\to$ $\OWL$ is the sublanguage inclusion obtained by the
syntactic restriction according to the definition of \EL, see
\nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-profiles:2009}. Since by definition, $\ELDL++$
is a syntactic restrition of $\SROIQ(D)$, $\ELDL++$ $\to$ $\SROIQ(D)$
is the corresponding sublogic inclusion.

\sclause{\QL $\to$ $\OWL$ and \DLLiteR $\to$ $\SROIQ(D)$}

\QL $\to$ $\OWL$ is the sublanguage inclusion obtained by the
syntactic restriction according to the definition of \QL, see
\nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-profiles:2009}. Since by definition, \DLLiteR
is a syntactic restrition of $\SROIQ(D)$, \DLLiteR $\to$ $\SROIQ(D)$
is the corresponding sublogic inclusion.

\sclause{\RL $\to$ $\OWL$ and $\RL$ $\to$ $\SROIQ(D)$}

\RL $\to$ $\OWL$ is the sublanguage inclusion obtained by the
syntactic restriction according to the definition of \RL, see
\nisref{W3C/TR REC-owl2-profiles:2009}. Since by definition, $\RL$
is a syntactic restrition of $\SROIQ(D)$, $\RL$ $\to$ $\SROIQ(D)$
is the corresponding sublogic inclusion.

\sclause{$\SimpleRDF \rightarrow \RDF$}

$\SimpleRDF \rightarrow \RDF$ is an obvious inclusion, except that
\SimpleRDF resources need to be renamed if they happen to have a predefined
meaning in \RDF. The model translation needs to forget the fixed parts
of \RDF models, since this part can always reconstructed in a unique
way, we get an isomorphic model translation. 

\sclause{$\RDF \rightarrow \RDFS$}

This is entierly analogous to $\SimpleRDF \rightarrow \RDF$.

\sclause{$\SimpleRDF \rightarrow \SROIQ(D)$}

\todonote{This translation is not really useful. Consider the
  RDF-OWL-reduct construction instead.}


A $\SimpleRDF$ signature is translated to $\SROIQ(D)$ by providing a class
$P$ and three roles $sub$, $pred$ and $obj$ (these reify the extension
relation), and one individual per $\SimpleRDF$ resource. A $\SimpleRDF$ triple
$(s,p,o)$ is translated to the \SROIQ(D) sentence
   $$\top \sqsubseteq \exists U. (\exists sub. \{s\} \sqcap \exists pred. \{p\} \sqcap  \exists obj. \{o\} ).$$
  From an \SROIQ(D) model ${\cal I}$, obtain a \SimpleRDF model by inheriting the universe
  and the interpretation of individuals (then turned into resources).
  The interpretation $P^{\cal I}$ of $P$ gives $P_m$, and $EXT_m$ is obtained
  by de-reifying,
 i.e. $$EXT_{m}(x):=\{(y,z) | \exists u . (u,x)\in pred^{\cal I},
  (u,y)\in sub^{\cal I}, (u,z,)\in obj^{\cal I} \}.$$
  $\RDF \rightarrow \SROIQ(D)$ is defined similarly. The theory of \RDF built-ins 
  is (after translation to \SROIQ(D)) added to any signature translation.
  This ensures that the model translation can add the built-ins.
%\Til{What if the OWL model satisfies more triples than the built-ins?}

\sclause{$\OWL \rightarrow FOL$}

\ssclause{Translation of Signatures}

 $\Phi((\Concepts, \Roles, \Individuals)) =  (F, P)$ with
\begin{itemize}
	\item function symbols: $F = \{a^{(1)} \vert a \in \Individuals\}$
	\item predicate symbols $P = \{A^{(1)} \vert A \in \category{C} \} \cup \{ R^{(2)} \vert R \in \category{R}\}$
\end{itemize}


\ssclause{Translation of Sentences}

Concepts are translated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\alpha_x(A) = A(x)$
 \item $\alpha_x(\lnot C) = \lnot \alpha_x (C)$
 \item $\alpha_x(C \sqcap D) = \alpha_x(C) \land \alpha_x(D)$
 \item $\alpha_x(C \sqcup D) = \alpha_x(C) \lor \alpha_x(D)$ 
 \item $\alpha_x(\exists R.C) = \exists y . (R(x,y) \land \alpha_y(C))$
 \item $\alpha_x(\exists U.C) = \exists y . \alpha_y(C)$
 \item $\alpha_x(\forall R.C) = \forall y . (R(x,y) \rightarrow \alpha_y(C))$
 \item $\alpha_x(\forall U.C) = \forall y . \alpha_y(C)$
 \item $\alpha_x(\exists R.\text{Self}) = R(x,x)$
 \item $\alpha_x(\leq n R. C) = \forall y_1,\ldots,y_{n+1} .  \bigwedge_{i=1,\ldots,n+1}(R(x,y_i) \land \alpha_{y_i}(C)) \rightarrow\bigvee_{1\leq i<j\leq n+1}y_i = y_j$
 \item $\alpha_x(\geq n R. C) = \exists y_1,\ldots,y_n . \bigwedge_{i=1,\ldots,n}(R(x,y_i) \land \alpha_{y_i}(C)) \wedge \bigwedge_{1\leq i<j\leq n}y_i\not= y_j $
 \item $\alpha_x(\{a_1, \ldots a_n \}) = (x=a_1\vee \ldots \vee x=a_n)$
\end{itemize}

For inverse roles $R^-$, $R^-(x,y)$ has to be replaced by $R(y,x)$, e.g.
 $$\alpha_x(\exists R^-.C) = \exists y . (R(y,x) \land \alpha_y(C))$$
This rule also applies below.


Sentences are translated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (C \sqsubseteq D) = \forall x.\, (\alpha_x(C) \rightarrow \alpha_x(D))$
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (a:C) = \alpha_x(C)[a/x]$\footnote{Replace $x$ by $a$.}
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (R(a,b)) = R(a,b)$
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (R \sqsubseteq S) = \forall x, y. R(x,y) \rightarrow S(x,y) $
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (R_1; \ldots; R_n \sqsubseteq R) =$\\
$ \forall x,y . (\exists z_1,\ldots z_{n-1} . R_1(x,z_1) \wedge R_2(z_1,z_2) \wedge \ldots \wedge R_n(z_{n-1},y)) \rightarrow R(x,y) $
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (\text{Dis}(R_1,R_2)) = \neg\exists x,y . R_1(x,y)\wedge R_2(x,y)$	
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (\text{Ref}(R)) = \forall x. R(x,x)$
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (\text{Irr}(R)) = \forall x. \neg R(x,x)$
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (\text{Asy}(R)) = \forall x,y . R(x,y) \rightarrow \neg R(y,x)$
 \item $\alpha_\Sigma (\text{Tra}(R)) = \forall x,y,z . R(x,y) \wedge R(y,z) \rightarrow R(x,z)$
\end{itemize}





\ssclause{Translation of Models}

\begin{itemize}
	\item For $M' \in \Models^{FOL}(\Phi \Sigma)$ define $\beta_\Sigma(M') := (\Delta, \cdot^I)$
	with $\Delta = |M'|$ and $A^I = M'_A, a^I = M'_a, R^I = M'_R$.
\end{itemize}

	\begin{proposition}
$C^\I = \left\{m \in M'_{\Thing} \lvert M' + \{x \mapsto m \} \models \alpha_x (C) \right\}$
	\end{proposition}
	
	\begin{proof} By Induction over the structure of $C$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A^\I = M'_A = \left \{m \in M'_{\Thing} \vert M' + \{x \mapsto m \} \models A(x)  \right\}$
	\item $(\lnot C)^\I = \Delta \setminus C^\I =^{I.H.} \Delta \setminus \{m \in M'_\Thing \lvert M' + \{x \mapsto m\} \models \alpha_x(C)\} = \{m \in M'_\Thing \vert M' + \{x \mapsto m\} \models \lnot \alpha_x(C)\}$

\infannex{Institutional semantics} \label{an:institution}

Note that the institute-based semantics for DOL does not cover
\syntax{SYMBOL-MAP}s, \syntax{combination}s and the construct \syntax{monomorphic}.  The institutional semantics will provide a mechanism for giving a semantics to the full distributed ontology language (DOL).


Institutions generalise institute to arbitary signature mappings
(called signature morphisms) between signatures.
\begin{definition}\label{def:inst} An
\defsty{institution} \bref{Institutions} is a quadruple $I=(\Sign,\sen,\IMod,{\models})$
consisting of the following:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item a category $\Sign$ of \emph{signatures} and \emph{signature morphisms},
\item a functor $\sen\map{\Sign}{\Set}$\footnote{$\Set$ is the
category having all small \textsc{}sets as objects and functions as
arrows.}  giving, for each signature $\Sigma$, the set of
\emph{sentences} $\sen(\Sigma)$, and for each signature morphism
$\sigma:{\Sigma}\to{\Sigma'}$, the \emph{sentence translation map}
$\sen(\sigma):{\sen(\Sigma)}\to{\sen(\Sigma')}$, where often
$\sen(\sigma)(\varphi)$ is written as $\sigma(\varphi)$, \item a
functor $\IMod:{\Sign^{op}}\to{\Cat}$\footnote {$\Cat$ is the category
of categories and functors. Strictly speaking, $\Cat$ is not a
category but only a so-called quasicategory, which is a category that
lives in a higher set-theoretic universe.} giving, for each signature
$\Sigma$, the category of \emph{models} $\IMod(\Sigma)$, and for each
signature morphism $\sigma\map{\Sigma}{\Sigma'}$, the \emph{reduct
functor\/} $\IMod(\sigma):{\IMod(\Sigma')}\to {\IMod(\Sigma)}$, where
often $\IMod(\sigma)(M')$ is written as $M'\restrict_{\sigma}$, and
$M'\restrict_{\sigma}$ is called the \emph{$\sigma$-reduct} of $M'$,
while $M'$ is called a \emph{$\sigma$-expansion} of
$M'\restrict_{\sigma}$,
\item a satisfaction relation
${\models_{\Sigma}}\subseteq|{\IMod(\Sigma)|\times\sen(\Sigma)}$ for
each $\Sigma\in |\Sign|$,
\end{itemize}
%
such that for each $\sigma\map{\Sigma}{\Sigma'}$ in $\Sign$ the
following \defsty{satisfaction condition} holds:
$$
(\star) \qquad M'\models_{\Sigma'}\sigma(\varphi) \mbox{ iff }
M'\restrict_{\sigma} \models_{\Sigma} \varphi
$$
for each $M'\in |\IMod(\Sigma')|$ and $\varphi\in \sen(\Sigma)$,
expressing that truth is invariant under change of notation and
context.  \qed
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Propositional Logic]\label{Prop}
The institution $\Prop$ is like the institute $\Prop$.
Signature morphisms are functions
$\sigma:{\Sigma_1}\to{\Sigma_2}$. The reduct of a $\Sigma_2$-model
$M_2$ along $\sigma:{\Sigma_1}\to{\Sigma_2}$ is the $\Sigma_1$-model
given by the composition $M_2\circ\sigma$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Common Logic - \Clogic]\label{CommonLogic}
The institution of Common Logic (\Clogic) is like the institute.
A \Clogic signature morphism consists of two maps
between the sets of names and of sequence markers, such that the property of being a discourse name
is preserved and reflected.\footnote{That is, a name is a discourse
name if and only if its image under the signature morphism is.}  
 Model reducts leave $\UR$, $\UD$, $\rel$ and $\fun$
untouched, while $\intCL$ and $\seq$ are composed with the appropriate
signature morphism component.
\end{definition}
%

Institute comorphisms can be generalised to institution comorphisms,
see \bref{inst-mor}.  

\begin{definition}[Institution Comorphism] Given two institutions $I$ and $J$ with $I = (\Sign^I,$ $ \Mod^I, \Sen^I, \models^I)$ and $J = (\Sign^J, \Mod^J,
\Sen^J, \models^J)$, an \defsty{institution comorphism} from $I$ to
$J$ consists of a functor $\Phi : \Sign^I \longrightarrow \Sign^J$, and
natural transformations $\beta: \Mod^J \circ \Phi \Longrightarrow \Mod^I$
and $\alpha: \Sen^I \Longrightarrow \Sen^J \circ \Phi$, such that 
$$ M'\models^{J}_{\Phi(\Sigma)}\alpha_{\Sigma}(\varphi) \Leftrightarrow
\beta_{\Sigma}(M')\models^I_{\Sigma}\varphi.
$$
holds, called the \defsty{satisfaction condition}.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Here, $\Phi(\Sigma)$ is the translation of signature $\Sigma$ from
institution $I$ to institution $J$, $\alpha_{\Sigma}(\varphi)$ is the
translation of the $\Sigma$-sentence $\varphi$ to a
$\Phi(\Sigma)$-sentence, and $\beta_{\Sigma}(M')$ is the translation
(or perhaps better: reduction) of the $\Phi(\Sigma)$-model $M'$ to a
$\Sigma$-model.

Institute morphisms can be generalised to institution morphisms.

\begin{definition}[Institution Morphism] Given two institutions $I$ and $J$ with $I = (\Sign^I,$ $ \Mod^I, \Sen^I, \models^I)$ and $J = (\Sign^J, \Mod^J,
\Sen^J, \models^J)$, an \defsty{institution morphism} from $I$ to
$J$ consists of a functor $\Phi : \Sign^I \longrightarrow \Sign^J$, and
natural transformations $\beta: \Mod^I \Longrightarrow \Mod^J \circ \Phi$
and $\alpha:  \Sen^J \circ \Phi \Longrightarrow \Sen^I $, such that 
$$ M\models^{I}_{\Sigma}\alpha_{\Sigma}(\varphi) \Leftrightarrow
\beta_{\Phi(\Sigma)}(M)\models^J_{\Phi(\Sigma)}\varphi.
$$
holds, called the \defsty{satisfaction condition}.
\end{definition}

An \defsty{institution-based heterogeneous logical environment} is like an
institute-based one, execpt that institutions (institution morphisms,
institution comorphisms) are used in place of institutes (institute
morphisms, institute comorphisms).

The full DOL language can be interpreted over an arbitrary

\begin{usecase}{Generating multilingual labels for menus in a user interface}{exists (but not yet DOL-based)}{Aligning (multiple OWL ontologies), Annotation}
  DO-ROAM (\textbf{D}ata and \textbf{O}ntology driven \textbf{R}oute-finding \textbf{O}f \textbf{A}ctivity-oriented \textbf{M}obility\footnote{\url{http://www.do-roam.org}}) is a web service with an interactive frontend that extends OpenStreetMap by an ontology-based search for located activities and opening hours \bref{do-roam}.  The service is driven by a set of different OWL ontologies that have been aligned to each other using the Falcon matching tool \bref{HuQu-08}.  The user interface of the DO-ROAM web frontend offers multilingual labels, which are maintained in close connection to the underlying ontologies.

  Porting DO-ROAM to DOL would allow for coherently representing the aligned ontologies as one distributed ontology, and it would allow for maintaining the user interface labels as annotations inside the ontology.
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}{Connecting devices of differing complexity in an Ambient Assisted Living setting}{core ontology (not DOL-based) and service environment exists – the DOL-based extensions not yet}{Logical links across different logics, connection to linked open datasets}
  Consider the following ambient assisted living (AAL) scenario:
  \begin{quote}
    Clara instructs her \textbf{wheelchair} to get her to the \textbf{kitchen} (\textbf{\underline{next door}} to the \textbf{living room}.  For \textbf{dinner}, she would like to take a \textit{pizza} from the \textbf{freezer} and bake it in the \textbf{oven}.  (Her diet is \textit{vegetarian}.)  \textbf{\underline{Afterwards}} she needs to rest in \textbf{bed}.
  \end{quote}
  Existing ontologies for ambient assisted living (\eg the OpenAAL\footnote{\url{http://openaal.org}} OWL ontology) cover the \emph{core} of these  concepts; they provide at least classes (or generic superclasses) corresponding to the concepts highlighted in \textbf{bold}.  However, that does not cover the scenario completely:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some concepts (here: food and its properties, \textit{italicized}) are not covered.  There are separate ontologies for that (such as the Pizza ontology\footnote{This is not a fully comprehensive food ontology, but rather a well-known sample OWL ontology; \cf \url{http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/}}), whereas information about concrete products (here: information about the concrete pizza in Clara's oven) would rather come from Linked Open Datasets than from formal ontologies.
  \item Not all concepts (here: space and time, \underline{underlined}) are covered at the required level of complexity.  OpenAAL says that appointments have a date and that rooms can be connected to each other, but not what exactly that means.  Foundational ontologies and spatial calculi, often formalized in first-order logic, cover space and time at the level of complexity required by a central controller of an apartment and by an autonomously navigating wheelchair.
  \item Thirdly, even description logic might be too complex for very simple devices involved into the scenario, such as the kitchen light switch, for which propositional logic may be sufficient.
  \end{itemize}
  Thus, an adequate formalization of this scenario has to be heterogeneous.  For example, one could imagine the following axioms:
  \begin{description}
  \item[light switch] ``light is switched on if and only if someone is in the room and it is dark outside'' – this could be formalized in propositional logic as $\mathrm{light\_on}\equiv\mathrm{person\_in\_room}\wedge\mathrm{dark\_outside}$.
  \item[freezer] ``a vegetarian pizza is a pizza whose toppings are all vegetarian'' – this could be formalized in description logic as $\mathrm{VegetarianPizza}\equiv\mathrm{Pizza}\sqcap \forall \mathrm{hasTopping}.\mathrm{Vegetarian}$
  \item[wheelchair] ``two areas in a house (\eg a working area in a room) are either the same, or intersecting, or bordering, or separated, or one is part of the other'' – this could be formalized as an RCC-style spatial calculus in first-order logic as $$\begin{array}{ll}\forall a_1, a_2 . & \mathrm{equal}(a_1, a_2) \veebar \mathrm{overlapping}(a_1, a_2) \veebar \mathrm{bordering}(a_1, a_2) \veebar \mathrm{disconnected}(a_1, a_2) \\
&\veebar \mathrm{part\_of}(a_1, a_2) \veebar \mathrm{part\_of}(a_2, a_1).\end{array}$$
  \end{description}
  
  DOL would be capable of expressing all that within one distributed ontology of heterogeneous ontologies arranged around an OWL core (here: the OpenAAL ontology), including logical links from OpenAAL to the other ontologies, as well as a re-declaration of a concrete pizza product from a product dataset as an instance of the Pizza OWL class.
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}{Interpreting the OWL formalization of the DOLCE foundational ontology in First-order logic}{potential use case}{Logical links}
  DOLCE is a foundational ontology that has primarily been formalized in the first-order logic ontology language KIF (a predecessor of Common Logic), but also in OWL (``DOLCE Lite'') \bref{dolce}. This ‘OWLized’ version was targeting use in semantic web services and domain ontology interoperability, and to provide the generic categories and relationships to aid domain ontology development. DOLCE has been used also for semantic middleware, and in OWL-formalised ontologies of neuroimaging, computing, ecology, and data mining and optimization.
  Given the differences in expressivity, DOLCE Lite had to simplify certain notions.  For example, the DOLCE Lite formalization of ``temporary parthood'' (something is part of something else at a certain point or interval in time) omits any information about the time, as OWL only supports binary predicates (a.k.a.\ ``properties'').  That leaves ambiguities for modeling a view from DOLCE Lite to the first-order DOLCE, as such a view would have to reintroduce the third (temporal) component of such predicates:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Should a relation asserted in terms of DOLCE Lite be assumed to hold for \emph{all} possible points/intervals in time, \ie should it be universally quantified?
  \item Or should such a relation be assumed to hold for \emph{some} points/intervals in time, \ie should it be existentially quantified?
  \item Or should a concrete value for the temporal component be assumed, \eg ``0'' or ``now''?
  \end{itemize}
  
  DOL would allow for formalizing all of these views and, given suitable consistency checking tools, allow for analyzing whether any such view would satisfy all further axioms that the first-order DOLCE states about temporal parthood.
\end{usecase}

\begin{usecase}{Extending the OWL Time ontology to a more comprehensive coverage of time}{potential use case}{Logical links}
The OWL Time ontology\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-owl-time-20060927/}} covers temporal concepts such as instants and intervals and has been designed for describing the temporal content of Web pages and the temporal properties of Web services.  While OWL is suitable for these intended applications, only a first-order axiomatization is capable of faithfully capturing all relevant notions, such as the trichotomy of the ``before'' relation: One instant is either before another one, or at the same time, or after.  Moreover, a relationship between facts expressed in terms of instants and facts expressed in terms of intervals (both of which is, independently, possible in OWL), can only be established via first-order logic, \eg by declaring an interval of length zero equivalent to an instant. 

A separate first-order axiomatization of OWL Time exists
[\bref{OWLTime},\bref{OWLSTime}].  DOL would instead allow for modeling
OWL Time as one coherent heterogeneous ontology, using OWL and, \eg,
Common Logic.\CLnote{This is also a use case for multiple namespaces:
  OWL supports namespaces, CL doesn't.}  For the temporal description
logic $\mathcal{DLR_{US}}$ for knowledge bases and logic-based
temporal conceptual data modelling [\bref{Artale02},\bref{Artale07a}];
$\mathcal{DLR_{US}}$ combines the propositional temporal logic with
the {\em Since} and {\em Until} operators and the (non-temporal)
description logic $\mathcal{DLR}$ and can be regarded as an expressive
fragment of the first-order temporal logic $L^{since, until}$. Within
DOL, this would enable one to have `lightweight' time aspects with OWL
Time, which are then properly formalised with $\mathcal{DLR_{US}}$ or
a leaner variant TDL-Lite [\bref{Artale07time}], where notions such as
(some time) ``before'' are given a formal semantics of the intended
meaning that the plain OWL Times human-readable object property does
not have. The latter, then, would enable the modeller to represent the
meaning---hence, restrict the possible models---and check the
consistency of the temporal constraints and so-called `evolution
constraints' in the ontology (evolution constraints constrain
membership of an object or an individual relation to a concept or
relationship over time). For instance, that each divorcee must have
been a participant in a marriage before, that boarding only may occur
after checking in, and that any employee must obtain a salary increase
after two years of employment. It also can be used to differentiate
between essential and immutable parthood, therewith being precise in
the ontology about, e.g., the distinction how a human brain is part of
a human (humans cannot live without it), versus how a hand is part of
a human (humans can live without it), versus how the hand is part of,
say, a boxer, which is essential to the boxer but only for has long as
he is a boxer [\bref{AGK08}].

COLORE stores metadata about its ontologies, which are represented using a custom XML schema that covers the following aspects\footnote{\url{http://stl.mie.utoronto.ca/colore/metadata.html}}, without specifying a formal semantics for them:
  \begin{description}
  \item[module provenance] author, date, version, description, keyword, parent ontology\footnote{Note that this use of the term ``module'' in COLORE corresponds
to the term \termref{structured ontology} in this international standard}
  \item[axiom source provenance] name, author, year\footnote{Note that this may cover any \termref{sentencs} in the sense of this international standard}
  \item[direct relations] maps (signature morphisms), definitional extension, conservative extension, inconsistency between ontologies, imports, relative interpretation, faithful interpretation, definable equivalence
  \end{description}

  DOL provides built-in support for a subset of the ``direct relations'' and specifies a formal semantics for them.  In addition, it allows for implementing the remainder of the COLORE metadata vocabulary as an ontology, reusing suitable existing metadata vocabularies such as OMV (\cf \aref{a:meta-vocab}), and it allows for implementing one or multiple Common Logic ontologies plus their annotations as one coherent distributed ontology.

\ssclause{$\FOL^{=}\to\FOL^{ms =}$}
Sublogic obtained by the syntactic restriction according to
the definition of $\FOL^{=}$.


\ssclause{$SROIQ(D)\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$} 

Straight-forward extension of the standard translation
\cite{borgida96expressiveness} mapping individuals to constants,
classes to unary predicates and roles to binary predicates.

\ssclause{$\ecoOWL \rightarrow \ecoFOL$}

$\ecoOWL \rightarrow \ecoFOL$ uses $SROIQ(D)\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$
twice, at the level of the base logic and at the level of the bridge
rules.

\ssclause{$\Prop\rightarrow  \FOL^{ms =}$} 

$\Prop\rightarrow \FOL^{ms =}$ is a subinstitute by mapping
propositional variables to nullary predicates.

  \ssclause{$\OBOOWL \rightarrow SROIQ(D)$} 

  $\OBOOWL \rightarrow SROIQ(D)$: signatures and sentences are
  translated according to the OBO standard, whereas the model
  translation is the identity (due to borrowing of model theory).

\ssclause{$\mathsf{OBO 1.4} \rightarrow \FOL^{=}$} 

$\mathsf{OBO 1.4} \rightarrow \FOL^{=}$ extends the composition
$\OBOOWL \rightarrow SROIQ(D)\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$ by an explicit
straight-forward coding of the additional features not present in
\OBOOWL.

\ssclause{$\SimpleRDF\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$}

The subinstitution comorphism from \SimpleRDF to $\FOL^{=}$ maps a a \SimpleRDF
signature $\mathbf{R_s}$ to the $\FOL^{=}$ signature
$\Phi(\mathbf{R_s})$ which has $\mathbf{R_s}$ as set of constants, and
moreover is equipped with a unary predicate $P$ and a ternary
predicate $EXT$.  A \SimpleRDF-sentence $(sub, pred, obj)$ is translated to
$EXT(sub, pred, obj)$.  Finally, a $\FOL^{=}$-model of
$\Phi(\mathbf{R_s})$ is translated to the \SimpleRDF which has the model's
universe as set of resources $R_m$, while $P_m$ is given by the
interpretation of $P$ and $S_m$ by the interpretation of the
constants. $EXT_m$ can be easily constructed from the interpretation
of $EXT$.

\ssclause{$\FOL^{=}\rightarrow$ \Flogic} 

$\FOL^{=}\rightarrow$ \Flogic is an obvious subinstitution.


\ssclause{$\DDLOWL \rightarrow \ecoOWL$} 

$\DDLOWL \rightarrow \ecoOWL$ is a subinstitution, because all
$\mathsf{DLL}$ bridge rules are \ecoOWL bridge rules.

\ssclause{$SROIQ(D)\rightarrow \DDLOWL$} 

$SROIQ(D)\rightarrow \DDLOWL$ is an obvious subinstitution: everything
is mapped into one component.

\ssclause{$\FOL^{=} \rightarrow  \ecoFOL$} 

$\FOL^{=} \rightarrow \ecoFOL$ is an obvious subinstitution:
everything is mapped into one component.

\ssclause{$\ecoFOL \rightarrow \FOL^{ms =}$}

$\ecoFOL \rightarrow \FOL^{ms =}$ maps each component to a sort, and
function and predicates symbols are typed with the sort of their
respective component.

\ssclause{$\RDF \rightarrow \FOL^{=}$} :

This is a straightforward extension of $\SimpleRDF \rightarrow \RDF$,
axiomatising explicitly the extra conditions imposed on models. $\RDFS
\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$ and $\RDFSOWL\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$ are
similar. The theory of the fixed part is (after translation to
$\FOL^{=}$) added to the translations of
signatures. %\Til{however: what if a FOL model fulfils more triples for the fixed part than those in its theory?}

\ssclause{$\FOL^{ms =} \rightarrow \FOL^{=}$} 

This is is a theoroidal subinstitution comorphism: a many-sorted
signature is translated to an unsorted one by turning each sort into a
unary predicate (these are called sort predicates), and each function
and predicate symbol is translated by erasing its typing information
in the signature, while turning it into a sentence, using the sort
predicates. A sentence is translated by erasing the type information
and relativising quantifiers to the sort predicates. A model is
translated by turning the interpretations of sort predicates into
carrier sets, and keeping functions and predicates.

\ssclause{$\ecoOWL \rightarrow SROIQ(D)$} 

This uses a similar technique: the different components are mapped
into classes, which are then used to relativise (using intersection
with these classes) sentences.

\ssclause{\Flogic $\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$} 

The additional ingredients of \Flogic are two binary relations and a
bunch of partial functions; all these can be coded as (suitably
axiomatised) predicates in a straightforward way. Note that the
translated signatures become infinite due to the parameterisation of
$I_\rightarrow$ etc.\ over the natural numbers.

\ssclause{$\Clogic \rightarrow \CASL$} 

This institute comorphism specifies the theory of lists and the
implicit components of \Clogic models explicitly in \CASL.

\ssclause{$\CASL\rightarrow \HOL$} 

This codes out partiality and subsorting using standard methods, while
induction axioms are translated to their explicit second-order
Peano-style formulation, see \cite{Mossakowski00b} for details.

\ssclause{\RelS $\rightarrow \FOL^{ms =}$} 

Database tables are mapped to predicates, and the involved datatypes
are specified in $\FOL^{=}$\footnote{Strictly speaking, for a complete
  specification of inductive datatypes, second-order logic is needed;
  in this case, the translation ends in $\HOL$.}. Integrity
constraints are expressible as first-order sentences, and given a
first-order model, its predicates are construed as database tables.

\ssclause{$\Prop\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$} 

This translates propositional variables to nullary predicates. The
model translation forgets the universe (and is hence not an
isomorphism). A theoroidal variant adds (to the signature translation)
the axiom $\forall x,y\,.\, x=y$ enforcing a singleton universe (then,
the model translation is at least an equivalence of categories).

\ssclause{$\Prop\rightarrow \Clogic$}

This is similar to $\Prop\rightarrow \FOL^{=}$.

\ssclause{$\Prop\rightarrow SROIQ(D)$} 

Each propositional variable in a signature is mapped to an atomic
SROIQ(D) class.  Additionally, the signature translation globally adds
one individual $a$ and the axiom $\top\sqsubseteq \{a\}$ expressing
that the domain consists of a single point.  A propositional sentence
(i.e. a Boolean combination of propositional variables) is mapped to
membership of $a$ in the corresponding SROIQ(D) class term (i.e. a
Boolean combination of atomic classes) --- note that this can be
expressed either as ABox statement $a:C$ or as TBox statement
$\{a\}\subseteq C$. In order to translate an SROIQ(D) model, for each
atomic class $A$ (resulting from a propositional variable $A$), $a:A$
is evaluated, and the result is assigned to the propositional variable
$A$.  The satisfaction condition is straightforward.

\ssclause{$\FOL^{=}\to \Clogic$} 

The signature translation maps constants, function symbols and
predicates to names. Sentences are left untouched. From a
\Clogic-model, it is possible to extract a $\FOL^{=}$-model by
restricting functions and predicates to those sequences that have the
length of the arity of the symbol (note that this restriction is the
reason for not getting an isomorphism).


\ssclause{$SROIQ(D)\rightarrow \RDFSOWL$} 

This is the $\mathsf{RDF}$ serialisation of SROIQ(D), formalised as a comorphism in \cite{LucanuLD06}.

\ssclause{$SROIQ(D) \rightarrow$ \Flogic} 

Translations from SROIQ(D) to \Flogic are discussed in \cite{Bruijn:2008}.
